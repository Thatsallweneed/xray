Characterization UPy Telechelics Prepared by Combination of ATRP and CuAAC Click ReactionsaTable aKey:Bulk ATRP of styrene and n-butyl acrylate were performed at 110 Â°C (for 1. 8 h with 77% conversion) and 70 Â°C (for 1 h with 90% conversion), respectively, using difunctional initiator and telechelic hydroxyl functional PBd was obtained from Cray Valley with 57% 1,2 vinyl contents. Conversion of endâ€“group transformation is 100% based on NMR, the recovered yield is 80â€“90% in all cases, and reactions were performed over 24 h.

Multiple Aggregation in SEC Elution ProfileSEC of UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy shows a small hump on the higher molecular weightside indicating the presence of dimers in THF solution (Figure 3b). Monotelechelic PBdâ€“UPy samples also showed such a dimeric peak in SEC eluogram. No such dimeric peaks were observed for PS and PnBA telechelic systems; however, when the UPy-Tz-PS-Tz-UPy was analyzed with a SEC equipped with the light scattering detector, it shows additional peaks corresponding to the aggregation of UPy domains, which are dependent on the sample concentration in solution (Figures 3 and 4a).",,ma5007705,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,0,propargyl and azide groups were totally absent in the ir spectrum of the polymer figure s2 and s3 supporting information and the ratio of mnnmrmnth in all cases is close to unity indicating almost 100 functionality of these upy telechelics figure 2 1h nmr spectra of upytelechelics prepared by cuaac click reaction upytzpbdtzupyupytzpnbatzupy andupytz pstzupy the starindicates residual solvent cdcl3 table 1 characterization upy telechelics prepared by combination of atrp and cuaac click reactionsatable akeybulk atrp of styrene and nbutyl acrylate were performed at 110 c for 1 8 h with 77 conversion and 70 c for 1 h with 90 conversion respectively using difunctional initiator and telechelic hydroxyl functional pbd was obtained from cray valley with 57 12 vinyl contents conversion of endgroup transformation is 100 based on nmr the recovered yield is 8090 in all cases and reactions were performed over 24 h mnth  conversion  mol wt of chainend functionality mn calculated based on initiator or end group functionalityfrom 1h nmr in cdcl3 determined from sec based on commercial specification multiple aggregation in sec elution profilesec of upytzpbdtzupy shows a small hump on the higher molecular weightside indicating the presence of dimers in thf solution figure 3b monotelechelic pbdupy samples also showed such a dimeric peak in sec eluogram no such dimeric peaks were observed for ps and pnba telechelic systems however when the upytzpstzupy was analyzed with a sec equipped with the light scattering detector it shows additional peaks corresponding to the aggregation of upy domains which are dependent on the sample concentration in solution figures 3 and 4a,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.5546562, 'word': 'upy', 'start': 277, 'end': 280}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96837205, 'word': 'upy - tz - pbd - tz - upy', 'start': 327, 'end': 344}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9688079, 'word': 'upy - tz - pnba - tz - upy', 'start': 345, 'end': 363}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9671479, 'word': '##upy - tz - ps - tz - upy', 'start': 368, 'end': 385}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.5035215, 'word': 'butyl acr', 'start': 567, 'end': 576}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.80226654, 'word': 'pbd', 'start': 761, 'end': 764}, {'entity_group': 'MATERIAL_AMOUNT', 'score': 0.556335, 'word': '57', 'start': 800, 'end': 802}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9656562, 'word': 'upy - tz - pbd - tz - upy', 'start': 1219, 'end': 1236}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7315506, 'word': 'pbda', 'start': 1369, 'end': 1373}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7218376, 'word': 'upy', 'start': 1375, 'end': 1378}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9440034, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 1476, 'end': 1478}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9431426, 'word': 'pnba', 'start': 1483, 'end': 1487}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96565837, 'word': 'upy - tz - ps - tz - upy', 'start': 1526, 'end': 1542}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.6560198, 'word': 'upy', 'start': 1674, 'end': 1677}]",
