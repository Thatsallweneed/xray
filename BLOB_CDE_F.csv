182,206,24,"The sample of UPy-Tz-PnBA-Tz-UPy was not used for the viscosity study and it is expected to have a similar viscosity behavior like UPy-Tz-PS-Tz-UPy. Figure 5. Viscosity profile of UPy telechelics and the effect of triazole on UPy chain end association of UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy and UPy-Tz-PS-Tz-UPy. Effect of Heating Rate and Aging on DSC Analysis of UPy TelechelicsEach DSC run has at least three heating and cooling cycles with a heating rate of 5, 10, and 20 Â°C/min. After the first DSC run, the sample was aged at room temperature for a given time interval before rerunning it for the second and the third heating cycles. The DSC profile of PBd-UPy samples at a heating rate of 10 Â°C/min shows the presence of endothermic peak at âˆ¼63 Â°C for UPy-PBd-UPy and at âˆ¼78 Â°C for UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy suggesting the presence of aggregated UPy domains (Figure S6). The UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy showed a higher melting peak supporting the presence of additional hydrogen bonding interactions involving the triazole group in the UPy domain aggregation. Enthalpy values of endothermic peak decrease in second and third heating cycle. However, a time-dependent DSC analysis of these two samples further supports the participation of triazole affects the reassociation dynamics of supramolecular association as the UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy sample shows a complete recovery of the melting peak after 6 h, whereas the UPy-PBd-UPy shows only a partial recovery of 33% in 6 h as evident from the corresponding enthalpies of dissociation (Table 2). This was calculated by using first heating cycle, and values of second and third run were divided by the enthalpy value of first cycle. Table 2.

Since the hydrogen-bonded UPy dimers are in equilibrium with aggregated domains, the heating rates alter the dynamics significantly. For the heating cycle at 20 Â°C/min, the endothermic peak recovery is very low for UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy, and the peak position shifts from 69. 36 to 103. 5 Â°C (Figure 6). For the sample without the Tz linker, the second and third heating cycles do not show any endothermic peak at all. Moreover, the peak recovery is very small for UPy-Tz-PBd-Tz-UPy (4. 426%). This clearly indicates, the time required to regenerate the original volume of UPy aggregated domains is not sufficient for higher heating/cooling rate. Meijer and co-workers in their earlier work on UPy-Kraton-UPy reported an absence of such a melting peak in the second heating cycleand considered an absence of crystalline aggregates, and chain extension leading to formation of very high molecular weight polymer were the attributes for the thermoplastic elastomeric properties of UPy-Kraton-UPy. However, the dynamics of linking chain in the present study is much higher due to low Mn, it may be possible that the presence of endothermic peak in relatively higher Mnmaterial, UPy-Kraton-UPy, could be absent on the experimental time scale since the time in between the subsequent heating and cooling cycles were not sufficient at the rate of 20 Â°C/min for the formation of UPy aggregates. However, recent work by Kautz and co-workers has shown the presence of a small endothermic peak at 69 Â°C in UPy-Kraton-UPy sample (DSC run at 10 Â°C/min ramping rate), which was attributed to an incomplete aggregation of lateral urethane group. The sample with a lateral urea linking group has a melting point of 129 Â°C, due to nanophase aggregated fiber formation by one-dimensional staking of urea groups. Figure 6.

The Tg values of UPy-Tz-PS-Tz-UPy and UPy-Tz-PnBA-Tz-UPy are in close agreement with the literature values considering their end-group modification (Figure S7)Interestingly, there is no endothermic peak in high Tg and nonpolar PS sample attributable to the formation of UPy associated domains up to 150 Â°C. The polar PnBA system also has an absence of endothermic peak.

302,315,13,"A supramol. polymer system is presented in which relatively short trimethylene carbonateprepolymers are linked via reversible quadruple hydrogen bonding ureidopyrimidinonemoieties. Several UPy-modified bifunctional and trifunctional TMC polymers were synthesized. Tunability of the mech. and thermal properties was achieved by mixing different trifunctional UPy-TMC with bifunctional UPy-TMC polymers. The concn. of UPy groups influenced the crystn. behavior of the materials. The UPy-modified TMC polymers displayed melting endotherms, which are caused by aggregation of the UPy units into small crystallites. It is assumed that the UPy dimers stack in the lateral direction due to urethane hydrogen bonding. At. force microscopy confirmed the presence of fiberlike stacks. These crystallites give the material its mech. strength and prevent flowing of the material after processing into 3D scaffolds. More importantly, these polymers can be processed quite easily at slightly elevated temps. Because of the strong temp. dependence of the reversible nature of the hydrogen bonds, their melt viscosities are low, while at temps. below 50Â° excellent mech. properties are found as a result of supramol. , phys. crosslinking. The UPy-TMC polymers are shown to be biocompatible and fibroblasts proliferate well on drop cast films of UPy-TMC. Thus, these novel supramol. UPy-TMC polymers are very promising, biocompatible, tunable, and easily processable biomaterials for applications such as tissue engineering.

Thermal PropertyThe thermal stability of the ABC star polymers was investigated by a thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). The onset decomposition temperatures of Star 1, Star 2, and Star 3 for a 5% weight loss are 335, 368, and 354 Â°C, respectively, indicating that the thermal stability of all the ABC star polymers is sufficient for application in future optoelectronic devices. Figure 4 shows the representative differential scanning calorimetrythermogram of Star 1. In the first cooling scan, the characteristic exothermic peak corresponds to the Tc of the P3HT segment. The fused Tg = 94. 4 Â°C can be seen corresponding to the PS and P2VP segments in the second heating scan. There is also a distinct endothermic peak of Tm = 237 Â°C for the P3HT segment. The DSC curve indicates the phase separation between the P3HT crystalline and PS+P2VP amorphous domains, although the phase separation between the PS and P2VP domains cannot be seen by DSC due to their similar Tg values. Star 2 and Star 3 show similar DSC curvesexcept for the somewhat reduced heat flow values corresponding to Tm,P3HT and Tc,P3HT, compared to Star 1, probably due to the interruption of crystalline growth in the star polymer having higher molecular weights for P2VP segments, as discussed in detail in the section for the GIXS Experiments.

739,748,9,"05). The synthetic methodology involves the following three stage reactions:the anionic linking reaction between P3HT-C4-Br and living anionic PS end-capped with 1,the transformation reaction of the 3-TBDMS moiety at the junction between the P3HT and PS segments into the PA moiety via the hydroxymethylphenyl moiety, andthe anionic linking reaction between PA-in-chain-functionalized P3HT-b-PS and living anionic P2VP. The representative DSC thermogram of Star 1 showed two distinct transition temperaturea at 94. 4 Â°C for the fused Tg value of PS+P2VP and at 237 Â°C for the Tm value of P3HT, indicating the existence of a phase separation between theand P3HT domains. The UVâ€“vis spectroscopy supported the vibronic absorption of the ABC star polymer films, indicating a high degree of ordering of the P3HT crystalline structures in the isolated P3HT domains. From a tapping mode AFM observation, continuous nanofibril phase-separated structures were clearly seen in the phase images of the star polymer thin films. The GISAXS and GIWAXS results confirmed the hierarchical nanofibril structures, in which the P3HT crystalline domains align with an â€œedge-onâ€ orientation in the exclusive area of the microphase-separated domains from the PS+P2VP ones in the thin films. It was also found that the fibril period distance as well as Ï€â€“Ï€ stacking distance of P3HT crystallines depended on the length of the P2VP segments.

Tx and Tm were determined as the peak temperatures of differential scanning calorimetrytraces on second cooling and heating, respectively. The scanning rate was 5Â°C/min, and measurements were performed under a N2 atmosphere. Flow-induced crystallization experiments were carried out in an apparatuscapable of imposing a strong shear pulse on a polymer melt for a precisely controlled time and prescribed thermal conditions. The flow channel consists of a rectangular slit with aspect ratio >10:1. The maximum strain that can be applied to the polymer melt is constrained by the geometry of the channel, as described in the Supporting Information of Kumaraswamy et al. We use pressure-driven slit flow because it allows quick imposition and removal of very high wall shear stresses. This experimental configuration has a trade-off in that the stress is not uniform, which must be taken into account when interpreting the depth-averaged observables recorded in real time, i. e. , birefringence, turbidity, and wide-angle X-ray diffracted intensity. In the velocity gradient direction, the imposed shear stress varies linearly from the value at the wallto 0 at the center of the flow channel (Figure 1). The experimental protocolwas as follows: the flow cell was filled with the polymer melt using a low wall shear stress at 215 Â°C; it was held at this temperaturefor 5 min to erase any history effects and to fully relax the melt;then the melt was cooled to Tx (137 Â°C), and a brief shear pulse with a specified wall shear stresswas imposed for a specific shearing time (ts). Subsequently, the progress of isothermal crystallization at 137 Â°C was monitored with rheo-optical methods for 75 min; then the flow cell was removed from the apparatus and allowed to cool to room temperature over âˆ¼10 min. The sample was then removed for ex-situ characterization. Control experiments under quiescent conditionswere performed, and two sets of ex-situ samples were prepared: one set was cooled after 75 min of isothermal crystallization for comparison with the shear experiments above, and the other set was given 14 h to crystallize isothermally to visualize the quiescent nucleation density at 137 Â°C.",,ma3000384,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,,,,1,the resulting fluff was filtered and washed with methanol and then sprayed with a measured amount of an acetone solution of a 11 mixture of antioxidantsto achieve 2000 ppm to the polypropylene finally the polymer fluff was dried at 80 c under vacuum for several days to ensure removal of all remaining solvent as a control baseppwas subjected to the same solution blending procedure b0 long chain concentrations cl up to 5 times their overlap concentrationwere examined table 21where rg is the radius of gyration and na is avogadros number using the literature value of rg212 0 39 gmol12long chains of 3500 kgmol long chains have cl  0 0036 gcm3 the blends were characterized by differential scanning calorimetryusing a perkinelmer dsc7 instrument with 69 mg of sample under a n2 atmosphere peak temperatures during the second heating and cooling cycle between 220 and 50 c at a rate of 5 cmin are reported as tm and tx respectively table 2 table 2 characteristics of the bimodal blends of 3 5m long chains in basepp short chainsa 3 5m wt clmgcm3clcltx ctm cb0000109 9149 60125p0 1251 070 3111 3151 1025p0 252 140 6110 9150 205p0 54 271 2110 6150 51p18 542 4110 8149 62p217 084 8110 8149 6acl is the concentration of 3 5m long chains tx and tm were determined as the peak temperatures of differential scanning calorimetrytraces on second cooling and heating respectively the scanning rate was 5cmin and measurements were performed under a n2 atmosphere flowinduced crystallization experiments were carried out in an apparatuscapable of imposing a strong shear pulse on a polymer melt for a precisely controlled time and prescribed thermal conditions the flow channel consists of a rectangular slit with aspect ratio 101 the maximum strain that can be applied to the polymer melt is constrained by the geometry of the channel as described in the supporting information of kumaraswamy et al we use pressuredriven slit flow because it allows quick imposition and removal of very high wall shear stresses this experimental configuration has a tradeoff in that the stress is not uniform which must be taken into account when interpreting the depthaveraged observables recorded in real time i e  birefringence turbidity and wideangle xray diffracted intensity in the velocity gradient direction the imposed shear stress varies linearly from the value at the wallto 0 at the center of the flow channel figure 1 the experimental protocolwas as follows the flow cell was filled with the polymer melt using a low wall shear stress at 215 c it was held at this temperaturefor 5 min to erase any history effects and to fully relax the meltthen the melt was cooled to tx 137 c and a brief shear pulse with a specified wall shear stresswas imposed for a specific shearing time ts subsequently the progress of isothermal crystallization at 137 c was monitored with rheooptical methods for 75 min then the flow cell was removed from the apparatus and allowed to cool to room temperature over 10 min the sample was then removed for exsitu characterization control experiments under quiescent conditionswere performed and two sets of exsitu samples were prepared one set was cooled after 75 min of isothermal crystallization for comparison with the shear experiments above and the other set was given 14 h to crystallize isothermally to visualize the quiescent nucleation density at 137 c,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.91314316, 'word': 'polypropylene', 'start': 186, 'end': 199}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7014429, 'word': 'base -

Macromolecules(2008), 41 (13), 4766-4776 CODEN: MAMOBX; ISSN:0024-9297. The formation and stability of a shear-induced shish-kebab structure was investigated by in situ rheo-SAXSand -WAXDmeasurements of highly entangled polyethylene melts based on two polymer blends, contg. small fractionsof ultra-high mol. wt. polyethyleneand high-d. polyethylene (HDPE). Immediately after shear, the combined SAXS and WAXD results at 142 Â°C confirmed the sole formation of shish without kebabs, indicating the interplay between the topol. deformation of highly entangled UHMWPE chains and the extended-chain crystn. of stretched segments without the participation of coiled segments. The presence of HDPE chains influenced the entanglement of UHMWPE but they were not involved in the shish-kebab formation at the initial stage of crystn. The final shish lengths in both blends were nearly identical at the same strain (. vepsiln. = 500), even though the UHMWPE concn. was different.

2277,2291,14,"Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConcluding RemarksReferencesResults and DiscussionCharacteristics of the Surfactomesogens (SM-Br)The SM-Br, having been subjected to rigorous column chromatography and crystallization purification procedures, are highly pure, as attested to by NMR and elemental analysis. Their thermal properties determined by DSC and TGA are summarized in Table 2. Their 1 wt % loss valuesgenerally lie between ca. 175 and 200 Â°C (usually slightly higher for the 6-spacer than the 10-spacer ones), with only NCâˆ’N(Et)10Q significantly lower (at 155 Â°C). All but two of the surfactomesogens are crystalline to high temperature, ranging from ca. 140 to 210 Â°C, where they melt directly to the isotropic phase, and recrystallize with a supercooling of typically 30âˆ’50 Â°C (keeping in mind that the data obtained after melting may be affected by slight degradation in the cases where the maximum scan temperature was near or beyond Td1%). Usually, the 6-spacer SM-Br has a higher melting point than the corresponding 10-spacer SM-Br. The two lower melting compounds, NCâˆ’N(Et)10Q (which has a double melting peak in the 100âˆ’110 Â°C range)and O2Nâˆ’N(Et)10Q (which has a complex melting pattern in the 120âˆ’150 Â°C range),do not recrystallize at all in the DSC conditions after melting but instead show an apparent glass transition near 40 Â°C in subsequent heating scans (in these two cases, the maximum temperature scans were well below Td1%). However, POM and XRD investigations showed that crystallization occurs very slowly in these compounds [more slowly for NC-N(Et)10Q than for O2Nâˆ’N(Et)10Q] during annealing, performed at ca. 95 Â°C for several hours. No evidence of a liquid crystal mesophase in this region could be found by POM or XRD. Table 2.

The dual TREF-SEC separation provided fractions of a few micro- or nanograms that were used to correlate the molecular structure of the polymer chains and their thermal properties (melting and crystallization behavior of the different macromolecules under a variety of different conditions). The SEC fractions were collected using the LC transform interface and subjected to FTIR and fast scanning DSC analysis. The SEC curves showed mono-, bi-, and multimodal molar mass distributions. The SEC fractions collected were analyzed by HPer DSC at 50 Â°C/min by which the thermal properties of the fractions could be established and salient details revealed. The findings were confirmed by structural information that was obtained using FTIR measurements. These results confirmed that even after TREF fractions were obtained they were complex regarding molar mass and chemical composition. By applying HPer DSC at scan rates of 5â€“200 Â°C/min and flash DSC at scan rates of 10â€“1000 Â°C/s, the metastability of one of the fractions was studied in detail. The high molar mass part of the material appeared to be constituted of both highly isotactic PP and low to medium propylene content ethylene copolymers (EPC). The medium molar mass part consisted of high to medium isotactic PP and of low propylene content EPC. The low molar mass part did not show ethylene crystallinity; only propylene crystallinity of medium to low isotacticity was found. DSC measurements of TREF-SEC cross-fractions at high scan rates in p-xylene successfully connected reversely to the slow scan rate in TREF elution, if corrected for recrystallization. All EPCâ€™s show only ethylene-type crystallization. The wealth of information obtainable from these method combinations promises to be extremely useful for a better understanding of the melting and crystallization processes of such complex materials. The ability to run DSC experiments at very high scan rates is an important prerequisite to understanding the melting and crystallization behavior under conditions that are very close to melt processing of these key commodity polymers.

4813,4850,37,"For these components, the often-used wording â€œamorphous fractionâ€ just describes the situation at 30 Â°C. It also reflects the fact that it is difficult to perform TREF at (sub)ambient temperatures because solvents such as p-xylene will crystallize, and one may face technical problems of operating and handling at lowered temperatures. In ref 8 the corresponding DSC second heating curves of the TREF fractions of 30â€“120 Â°C were reported, as measured from 25 to 200 at 10 Â°C/min. The authors concluded that no melting endotherm is present in the 30 Â°C fraction as was expected for a random ethyleneâ€“propylene copolymer (EP rubber). All fractions eluting from 60 to 100 Â°C exhibit two melting endotherms, namely at 89 and 112 Â°C (fraction 60 Â°C), 103 and 130 Â°C (fraction 80 Â°C), 118 and 146 Â°C (fraction 90 Â°C), 118 and 150 Â°C (fraction 100 Â°C). Clearly, in melting subsequent to crystallization from the melt, these polymer fractions show such distinct melting temperatures, and the presence oftwo crystallizable components melting at different temperatures must be assumed that are caused by appreciable differences in molecular structures. Figure 1. Mass distribution in percent per temperature increment as a function of the elution temperature for the TREF fractions obtained. The 110 and 120 Â°C fractions show single, distinct melting peaks at 159 and 161 Â°C, respectively, which are ascribed to highly isotactic PP. With increasing TREF elution temperatures, the peak areas increase indicating increasing crystallinities. Data on the 130 Â°C fraction were not available: they are expected to be similar to the 100 and 110 Â°C fractions. Elution at one and the same TREF temperature, and bimodality of the melting point distribution, as seen for some of the DSC curves, can have various causes. First, crystallization in a solvent under TREF conditions is different from crystallization from the melt for various reasons. The molar mass influence on crystallization is appreciable for the pure polymer, while in solution the influence is dependent on the quality of the solvent and the concentration. Second, for the present case, molecules that dissolve at one and the same TREF elution temperature can also do so because the melting point depression caused by the solventis larger for a polymer with propylene crystallinity than in the case of ethylene crystallinity. In this way, differences in e. g. maximum or end melting points in the case of melt crystallization between molecules having ethylene-basedand propylene-basedcrystallization can becanceled by having crystallization done in a solvent; see further on at the analysis of the 80 Â°Cand 90 Â°CTREF fractions. In order to determine possible differences in melting behavior across the MMD, each of the TREF fractions was fractionated according to molar mass by HT-SEC; see Figure 2, showing all SEC curves obtained on the3V, and on 3V x. y samples. Figure 2. High-temperature SEC curves obtained on the3Vand on 3V TREF fractions thereof as obtained at various TREF elution temperatures: 30, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 Â°C. See text for explanation. The SEC curves are plotted in their respective temperature ranges of elution. For example: fraction 3V 100 is plotted in between the temperatures 90 and 100 Â°C, since it has been obtained by elution in that temperature range; the preceding fraction 3V 90 covered the temperature range from 80 until 90 Â°C, and the next fraction 3V 110 is plotted in the range from 100 to 110 Â°C, and so forth. From this plot it is clear that some fractions are bimodal, meaning that part of the low molar mass polymer chains are dissolved at the same temperature as a part of the high molar mass polymer chains. One may wonder whether the bimodality of the SEC curves, seen for the 60, 80, and 90 Â°C TREF fractions, is connected with the bimodality of the 60, 80, 90, and 100 Â°C TREF fractions seen in the DSC curves(see earlier remark). The next part of this topic is addressed on the basis of TREF-SEC cross-fractions, using DSC and FTIR analyses after deposition on a disk by the LC transform interface. Details of the experimental method using the LC transform interface can be found in the Experimental Section and in ref 2. Analysis of the Bulk SampleIn the preceding paper,results on the bulk sample 3V have been discussed in detail. The crystallization and melting behavior by HPer DSC at 10 and 50 Â°C/min was seen to be dominated by the high-isotacticity PP molecules present, overshadowing the other components in the PP system. The FTIR information regarding the PP and PE content and the PP and PE crystallinities confirm this conclusion: the propylene content across the MMD is constant, and the ethylene content of 10. 5 mol % is essentially zero, as the level is too low to be detected (in the bulk sample), across the MMD. Similarly, the propylene crystallinity showed to be constant. However, no ethylene crystallinity is noticed; most probably its contribution is too low to be detected, as it is overshadowed by the PP. The crystallization behavior is sensitive to the cooling rate: changing from 10 to 50 Â°C/min lowers the crystallization peak maximum temperature by 10 Â°C. However, in both cases the subsequent heating at 50 Â°C/min leads to a melting peak maximum temperature of 159 Â°C. Therefore, it is quite obvious that reorganization takes place during heating and is not hindered by the heating rate of 50 Â°C/min. Analysis of TREF Fraction 3V 60 (3. 4 wt % of Total)This is the first TREF fraction with a bimodal MMDand with two melting peaks in the DSC curvesimilar to all DSC curves of TREF fractions up to 100 Â°C. Two SEC fractions with an extreme difference in molar mass were chosen see Figure 3c): one centered around a molar mass of 1 000 000 g/moland the other around 2000 g/mol (bottom box). Figure 3. SEC-DSC analysis of sample TREF 3V 60. DSC curves of first cooling and second heating of two SEC fractions of TREF fraction 3V 60. These fractions represent the two peaks in the SEC curve; the corresponding DSC curves reflect the crystallization and melting behavior. The first heating curves resemble those of the second heating and are not plotted here. The DSC curve of the high molar mass part of the MMD suggests to represent an EP copolymer crystallizing around 60 Â°C and showing a characteristic,broad melting curve with a peak maximum temperature of âˆ¼80 Â°C and an end melting temperature of 95 Â°C. The curves resemble EP copolymers such as those in ref 24; see e. g. the EP copolymer EJ 207 as a very typical example.",,ma3008702,1,1,1,1,1,0.5,tm is in the figure,,,1,for these components the oftenused wording amorphous fraction just describes the situation at 30 c it also reflects the fact that it is difficult to perform tref at subambient temperatures because solvents such as pxylene will crystallize and one may face technical problems of operating and handling at lowered temperatures in ref 8 the corresponding dsc second heating curves of the tref fractions of 30120 c were reported as measured from 25 to 200 at 10 cmin the authors concluded that no melting endotherm is present in the 30 c fraction as was expected for a random ethylenepropylene copolymer ep rubber all fractions eluting from 60 to 100 c exhibit two melting endotherms namely at 89 and 112 c fraction 60 c 103 and 130 c fraction 80 c 118 and 146 c fraction 90 c 118 and 150 c fraction 100 c clearly in melting subsequent to crystallization from the melt these polymer fractions show such distinct melting temperatures and the presence oftwo crystallizable components melting at different temperatures must be assumed that are caused by appreciable differences in molecular structures figure 1 mass distribution in percent per temperature increment as a function of the elution temperature for the tref fractions obtained the 110 and 120 c fractions show single distinct melting peaks at 159 and 161 c respectively which are ascribed to highly isotactic pp with increasing tref elution temperatures the peak areas increase indicating increasing crystallinities data on the 130 c fraction were not available they are expected to be similar to the 100 and 110 c fractions elution at one and the same tref temperature and bimodality of the melting point distribution as seen for some of the dsc curves can have various causes first crystallization in a solvent under tref conditions is different from crystallization from the melt for various reasons the molar mass influence on crystallization is appreciable for the pure polymer while in solution the influence is dependent on the quality of the solvent and the concentration second for the present case molecules that dissolve at one and the same tref elution temperature can also do so because the melting point depression caused by the solventis larger for a polymer with propylene crystallinity than in the case of ethylene crystallinity in this way differences in e g maximum or end melting points in the case of melt crystallization between molecules having ethylenebasedand propylenebasedcrystallization can becanceled by having crystallization done in a solvent see further on at the analysis of the 80 cand 90 ctref fractions in

text for explanation the sec curves are plotted in their respective temperature ranges of elution for example fraction 3v 100 is plotted in between the temperatures 90 and 100 c since it has been obtained by elution in that temperature range the preceding fraction 3v 90 covered the temperature range from 80 until 90 c and the next fraction 3v 110 is plotted in the range from 100 to 110 c and so forth from this plot it is clear that some fractions are bimodal meaning that part of the low molar mass polymer chains are dissolved at the same temperature as a part of the high molar mass polymer chains one may wonder whether the bimodality of the sec curves seen for the 60 80 and 90 c tref fractions is connected with the bimodality of the 60 80 90 and 100 c tref fractions seen in the dsc curvessee earlier remark the next part of this topic is addressed on the basis of trefsec crossfractions using dsc and ftir analyses after deposition on a disk by the lc transform interface

have been discussed in detail the crystallization and melting behavior by hper dsc at 10 and 50 cmin was seen to be dominated by the highisotacticity pp molecules present overshadowing the other components in the pp system the ftir information regarding the pp and pe content and the pp and pe crystallinities confirm this conclusion the propylene content across the mmd is constant and the ethylene content of 10 5 mol  is essentially zero as the level is too low to be detected in the bulk sample across the mmd similarly the propylene crystallinity showed to be constant however no ethylene crystallinity is noticed most probably its contribution is too low to be detected as it is overshadowed by the pp the crystallization behavior is sensitive to the cooling rate changing from 10 to 50 cmin lowers the crystallization peak maximum temperature by 10 c however in both cases the subsequent heating at 50 cmin leads to a melting peak maximum temperature of 159 c therefore it is

4852,4887,35,"The chain statistics of this EP copolymer is between alternating and random, with a product of copolymer reactivity ratios, rEÂ·rPof about 0. 50. As the statistics of the present TREF fraction is unknown, it is too speculative to make any further conclusions, the more so because the literature example has been polymerized in a very much designed and ideal way, using a single site, vanadium-type catalyst, leading to a homogeneous type of copolymer. For such a copolymer, the melting curve is expected to resemble the broad ethylene sequence length distribution (ESLD), resulting from the copolymerization statistics. The amount of propylene of the whole fraction 3V 60 is much higherâ€”45 mol %(7)â€”by which most of the propylene units must be located in molecules of the rest of the distribution, and thus is to be found as a propylene-rich part of the MMD in the medium and lower molar mass regions. The DSC curve of the low molar mass part of the MMD suggests to be originating from low-isotacticity PP because the difference, Î”T, between the melting peak maximum temperature of approximately Tm = 115 Â°C and the crystallization peak maximum temperature of approximately Tc = 86 Â°C seems to be somewhat too largeto be caused by a polyethylene type of crystallization. The occurrence of polypropylene in the lower molar mass region would also account for the rest of the propylene content as mentioned before. The reasoning given is completely confirmed by the FTIR information on the fraction studied (see Figure 4). The compositionand their crystallinity distributions across MMD are determined as explained in our previous publications. Figure 4. SEC-FTIR analysis of the 60 Â°C TREF fractionillustratingthe propyleneandthe ethylenedistributions as well as their crystallinity distributionsand (d), respectively. In Figure 4, it is seen that propyleneis present at all molar masses, and its content increases toward low molar masses. The high molar mass region shows almost exclusively ethylene crystallinity (Figure 4d), while the propylene present is slightly or not crystalline (Figure 4c). In the low molar mass region ethylene is absentwhich is why no ethylene crystallinity is noticed (Figure 4d), but only propylene crystallinity (Figure 4c). Both DSC and FTIR results point to a simple explanation of the double melting behavior of the whole TREF fraction 3V 60, as seen in ref 8 and discussed earlier with crystallization/melting peak maximum temperatures of 63 Â°C/89 Â°C and 112 Â°C (at 10 Â°C/min), namely to connect these to the melting of crystalline structures constituted by ethylene units and propylene units, respectively. Analysis of TREF Fraction 3V 80 (3. 5 wt % of Total)In our preceding paperresults on TREF fraction 80 Â°C and SEC fractions thereof have been discussed. Now, extended measurements show additional, interesting information on this sample. Figure 5. SEC separation of sample TREF 3V 80. SEC curve with boxes indicating the molar mass ranges covered by the HPer and Flash DSC measurements shown in Figures 6 and 7 (see text). Red box: middle molar mass part; blue box: low molar mass part; black arrow: molar mass of sample measured by flash DSC 1; green box: molar mass range measured by HPer DSC and combined with flash DSC 1 results (see Figure 7). In Figure 5, the MMD of sample TREF 3V 80 is shown as well as crystallization and melting peak maximum temperaturesfor SEC fractions obtained by DSC. In this figure, three different melting behaviors are seen, and Figure 6 shows characteristic DSC curves, representative for the three groups of samples, distinguishable by their melting behavior:Figure 6. DSC analysis of different molar mass fractions of sample TREF 3V 80:a middle-M part, see red box in Figure 5;a low-M part, see blue box in Figure 5;the lowest-part M of less than 4000 g/mol. Group 1Fractions of the middle molar mass part of the MMD, having low melting peak maximum temperatures between 103 and 111 at 50 Â°C/min cooling/heating rate. In ref 8, 103 Â°C has been found for the corresponding melting peak at 10 Â°C/min cooling/heating rate, which makes sense. As an example, in Figure 6a DSC curves are shown of the characteristic sample at 150Â°â€“180Â° (angle on the Ge disk corresponding to a retention time of 20. 5â€“22 min), covering the molar masses as indicated by the red box in Figure 5 (roughly 10â€“80 kg/mol). Varying the scan rates from 5, 50, to 100 Â°C/min, the DSC curves of this sample do not vary much, and values of approximately Tc âˆ¼ 91 Â°C and Tm âˆ¼ 110 Â°C are found. Group 2Fractions of the low-M part of the MMD have high melting peak maximum temperatures, between 130 and 136 Â°C, at 50 Â°C/min cooling/heating rate. For comparison, in ref 8 130 Â°C has been found for the corresponding melting peak at 10 Â°C/min cooling/heating rate, which again makes sense. As an example, in Figure 6c, DSC curves are shown of the characteristic sample from 210Â° to 270Â° (retention time 23. 5â€“26. 5 min), covering the molar masses less than 4000 g/mol. Group 3As indicated by the blue box in Figure 5, the SEC fraction at 180Â°â€“210Â° (retention time 22â€“23. 5 min) combines the characteristics of groups 1 and 2 by showing both low and high melting temperatures in one and the same curve. Varying the scan rates from 5, 50, 100 to 200 Â°C/min for this sample results in DSC figures with approximately Tc âˆ¼ 100 Â°C and Tm âˆ¼ 136 Â°C. In addition, 5 out of 9 measurements done show an additional low-melting peak at âˆ¼111 Â°C in the second heating curve (see the peak at 109 Â°C in Figure 6b). This suggests that an additional componentâ€”and probably a low propylene content EPCâ€”is present of which the meltingis separated from the main medium-isotacticity PP peak (with a maximum at 135. 5 Â°C), while their crystallization peaks coincide at 99. 1 Â°C. It is possible that the nucleation of one of these is triggered by the other. At least two explanations of this split into three different groups are possible:First, for PE it has been reportedthat the melting peak maximum temperature increases when the molar mass is increased from paraffins to high molar mass linear polyethylenesin excess of 1 000 000 g/mol.","[{'melting_points': [{'value': '115', 'units': 'Â°C'}]}] [{'melting_points': [{'value': 'âˆ¼110', 'units':

4891,4910,19,"The melting behavior does not mimic this behavior because of the occurrence of extensive reorganization by sliding diffusion of chains during cooling after crystallization and subsequent heating toward melting. This specific crystallization behavior is strongly dependent on the cooling rate: at lower scan rates the decrease in Tc with increasing M is less; at higher rates Tc decreases appreciably with increasing M. For branched polyethylenes, be it either copolymers or branched material like LDPE, the effects have been seen to be stronger, and even the melting behavior becomes affected. For instance LDPE, at constant branching, shows a 12 Â°C lowering of Tc and 7 Â°C for Tm, occurring at the same apparent molar mass as for LPE. Obviously, reorganization is not possible anymore because the short side chain branching hinders sliding diffusion and by that the process of reorganization is slowed down drastically. One may speculate that PP is affected in the same way, noticing that the abrupt change in Tm by 25â€“30 Â°C in Figure 5 also occurs at âˆ¼20 000 g/mol. However, Tc also shows a decrease with increasing M butâ€”in sharp contrast with the PE caseâ€”to a lesser extent of about 15 Â°C and not in an abrupt way. Second, as before for 3V 60, the differences in Tm and Tc could reflect different molecular structures. The highest molar mass SEC fractions have reasonably narrow crystallization peaks with a long low-temperature tail and broad melting endotherms (see Figure 11 in ref 2), characteristic of polymers with crystallizable ethylene sequence lengths found e. g. in ethyleneâ€“propylene copolymers. The low molar mass fractions show much higher melting temperatures, and from the difference between the peak maximum temperatures for meltingand crystallization (Tc), Î”T = Tm â€“ Tc, it is supposed that these temperatures point to medium-isotacticity PP. Evaluating the results obtained with FTIR leads to the conclusion that these confirm the second possibility. This does not necessarily rule out the first one: possibly the melting and crystallization temperature distributions are also lowered partly because of increasing molar mass. It is clear that the bimodal melting behavior reported earlieris explained by the occurrence of the 2 groups of molecules differing in melting behavior, while â€œintermediateâ€ molecules indicated as group 3 can also show up in the same molar mass range of limited width. It has to be realized that though the melting behavior after crystallization from the melt is very different, all three groups match by eluting in the same TREF temperature range. Interestingly group 3 consists of molecules having the same M, meaning that the matching toward the same elution temperature is mainly governed by the ethylene sequences in the ESLD of the low propylene content EPC and governed by the isotactic sequences for the medium-isotacticity PP. To probe the (meta)stabilityof the crystallites and the occurrence of possible reorganization phenomena, a more extensive evaluation has been performed by applying a variety of combinations of scan rates of 5, 50, 100, and 200 Â°C/min using HPer DSC. Increasing the cooling rate from the standard rate of 50 to 100 Â°C/min results in the lowering of the crystallization peak maximum temperature by a maximum of 5 Â°C. In the case of decreasing the cooling rate to 5 Â°C/min, crystallization occurs 10 Â°C higher than at a cooling rate of 50 Â°C/min.

DSC curves for three representative samples of 3V 90. 3, reflecting the coverage of the peaks in the SEC curve, see colored boxes; the high-M peak (sample 3V 90. 3, 120Â°â€“160Â°); middle-M peak (3V 90. 3, 180Â°â€“220Â°); and the two low-M peaks for sample 3V 90. 3, 220Â°â€“260Â°). Following the same reasoning as for the other samples discussed, Figure 8a representsgroup 1 melting behavior: it shows the presence of a copolymerized polyethylene, more specifically low propylene content EPC, in the high-M part of the MMD for sample 3V 90, 120Â°â€“160Â°. The crystallization curve indicates the presence of more than one species crystallizing, though these do not show up separately in the melting curve. The curves in Figure 8brepresenting the middle part of the MMD show group 3 behavior. The presence is seen of both PP having a lowered isotacticity or a â€œmedium isotacticityâ€ PP (a melting peak maximum of 138. 6 Â°C) and in addition most probably a propylene-copolymerized PE, a low-propylene content EPC (a melting peak maximum at 115. 7 Â°C). Again, it is seen that the crystallization temperatures of both the polymers present coincide, giving rise to a single crystallization peak with a maximum at 100. 4 Â°C. The main melting peak at the highest temperatures shows two peaks at 138. 6 and 145 Â°C, most probably caused by recrystallization. It illustrates that through a thermal history melting temperatures of 140 Â°C and higher can be realized; see also the first heating curve. The third SEC fractionrelated to the low molar mass part of the MMDrepresents group 2 melting behavior. Surprisingly, it again shows PP crystallinity, but at lower temperatures than the middle part of the MMD. This could be explained by the decreasing effect lower molar masses have on the crystallization and melting. Seeing the change in molecular structure with decreasing molar mass from the one extremeâ€”high molar mass and low propylene content PEâ€”to the other extremeâ€”low molar mass and medium-isotacticity PPâ€”it is evident that the middle molar mass fraction can be seen as an intermediate between the two extremes, showing the presence of both low propylene content EPC and medium-isotacticity PP.

According to FTIR (see Figure 9), in the highest-M part of the MMDâ€”not covered by the boxes shown in Figure 8â€”propylene is present but not crystallized; thus only ethylene crystallinity will be present. In the high-M part of the MMD some PP crystallinity would be present, which is not confirmed by DSC.

The TREF fraction is the first one, whichâ€”with increasing TREF temperatureâ€”did show one melting endotherm on heating by DSC, while all TREF fractions eluting from 60 to 100 Â°C exhibited two melting endotherms. Also, its SEC curve is unimodal (see Figure 10).

4966,4982,16,"Of interest is thatâ€”analogous to TREF fraction 3V 90â€”the shoulders and main peaks are most probably related to each other via recrystallization. To prove this, a variation of the heating rate subsequent to crystallization during cooling at 50 Â°C/min has been applied: besides heating at the same rate of 50 Â°C/min subsequent to cooling, heating at 10 and 250 Â°C/min have also been realized, presented in Figure 11c. Heating at 250 Â°C/min eliminates the highest melting peak maximum, by which the new maximum is situated at a slightly lowered value of 153 Â°C. Heating at 10 Â°C/min strengthens recrystallization, giving rise to two pronounced maxima. Clearly, the peak without recrystallization is marked by a maximum at âˆ¼154 Â°C whilea second, high-temperature peak arises at âˆ¼162 Â°C at the expense of the low-temperature peak. Heating at 250 Â°C/min from 160 Â°C on results in an â€œovershootâ€: the experimental curve lies under the line extrapolated for the melt. However, this phenomenon does not influence the conclusions with respect to recrystallization. DSC Results on Melting of TREF-SEC Cross-Fractions: An OverviewHitherto, salient DSC curves of specific TREF-SEC cross-fractions have been presented. Figure 12 gives an overview by displaying melting peak maximum temperatures, measured at 50 Â°C/min, on SEC fractions for all TREF fractions studied. The cross-fractions have been divided into two groups on the basis of high or low Î”T, meaning as before the difference between the peak maximum temperatures for melting, Tm, and crystallization, Tc (not shown here), Î”T = Tm â€“ Tc. Propylene crystallinity relates to crystallization and melting behavior with a higher Î”T anda higher Tm compared to ethylene-based polymers. From Figure 12b, a good correlation between Tm and TelutionTREF is seen for both groups of cross fractions having propylene and ethylene crystallinities. The group with propylene crystallinity shows an increase of Tm and TelutionTREF because of increasing isotacticity resulting in longer isotactic propylene sequences. The group with ethylene crystallinity shows an increase of Tm and TelutionTREF because of decreasing propylene content, resulting in longer ethylene sequences within the chains of these ethyleneâ€“propylene copolymers (EPC). The lowest Tm values are expected for ethyleneâ€“propylene rubbershaving short ethylene sequences. However, EPR, which is supposed to crystallize at (sub)ambient temperatures, and therefore it shows up in the TREF fraction 30 Â°C, will be reported separately.

4985,5016,31,"3, the high molar mass fraction (rotation angle 120Â°â€“160Â°), see also Figure 13a, represents low-propylene content EPC. The medium molar mass fraction (rotation angle 180Â°â€“220Â°), see Figure 13b, was judged to be an intermediate between the extremes of PP and propylene copolymerized polyethylenebecause it contains both components, though the PP content is much higher. The constituents of this intermediate fraction differ considerably with respect to their melting temperaturesâ€”116 Â°C for the PE component and 139 Â°C/145 Â°C for the PP componentâ€”while their crystallization maximum temperatures probably coincide at 100 Â°C (see Figure 8). Compared to PE types, PP can show an appreciable Î”T. Despite these differences in the TREF dissolution procedure they both elute in between 80 and 90 Â°C, clearly pointing to the fact that Î”T is polymer- and solvent-dependent and different for crystallization and melting of the pure polymerand in solution. Thus, in the present case two different polymers, with different thermal behavior when measured from their melt state, elute in the same temperature range, masking these differences. Such occurrence of coeluting polymers with quite different molecular structures in the same temperature range leads to the complexity of interpreting the data and of elucidating the molecular structure. To get an impression of the release of molecules during elution in a TREF setup, a dissolution experiment by DSC of 3V 90, in p-xylene, was performed. The concentrations are reasonably comparable: TREF 1 wt % and HPer DSC around 2 wt %. However, the cooling and heating rates are very different: very slow in case of TREF and 10â€“50 Â°C/min for DSC. Despite this, the result is clarifying (see Figure 13b): the final dissolution temperature by DSC of fraction 3V 90 coincides with the end temperature of the TREF range for the fraction used, 90 Â°C. Notice that the dissolution by DSC starts 25 Â°C before 80 Â°C which is caused by chains that partly dissolve, giving rise to a heat flow rate in the DSC and at the cost of a heat of fusion measured, but which cannot yet elute in TREF due to the presence of segments in the same chain that are more stable than the dissolved ones and by that still stay connected to other molecules within the same and/or other crystallites. In general, a chain will elute when the most stable segment of that chain dissolves. Because incorporation of ethylene and propylene units will always end up with ethylene and propylene distributions along the chains, various kinds of sequence lengths will be available. Figure 12.

Two 2D projections of the data shown inwith the same axes. Especially, for a given sequence of dissolved ethylene units or of isotactic propylene units, longer sequences and/or more perfect ones will in principle be still stable at the temperature of dissolution, and will dissolve and elute at higher temperatures and so on until the most stable sequence dissolves and the chain can elute. In contrast, the DSC will measure dissolution at the temperature/time of transition, whether they elute or not (yet). Figure 13. SEC-solution DSC analysis of sample TREF 3V 90.

Both samples were measured between 10 and 130 Â°C with an isothermal stay of 15 min at 130 Â°C. The TREF elution temperature range of 80â€“90 Â°C is indicated by a green box. Insets: the parts of the MMD by SEC as covered by the samples are indicated by boxes as before. From Figure 13a, one could conclude that in this case the dissolution range in TREF is beyond the 80â€“90 Â°C range. However, this â€œovershootâ€ is caused by recrystallization during heating of the solution in the DSC, giving a bimodal DSC heating curve with dissolution peak maxima at 83 and 95 Â°C. The fact that this sample has been eluted between 80 and 90 Â°C in TREF means that all material has been eluted for which the whole chain is dissolved before or at 90 Â°C and which chain is not capable anymore of recrystallization in xylene at 90 Â°C. If it would recrystallize just before and at 90 Â°C, then it would elute at temperatures higher than 90 Â°C, in the next elution temperature range of 90â€“100 Â°C. To prove the occurrence of recrystallization, one usually increases the heating rate, by which less time is available for recrystallization and remelting. However, heating at 50 Â°C/min is a suitable but already a high heating rate for a polymer in solution in LVC pans. Therefore, the choice was made to decrease the cooling rate instead. Thus, the fact that recrystallization occurs for the SEC fraction 120Â°â€“160Â° of TREF fraction 3V 90.",,ma3008702,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,too long >15,,,,3 the high molar mass fraction rotation angle 120160

For HPer DSC, samples of the TREF-SEC cross-fractions obtained were cut from the aluminum disk, resulting in 7 parts that vary in molar mass. Increasing the scan rates to 50 Â°C/min gave reasonable to good DSC curves, and in all cases the thermal behavior could be recorded very well. In the case that crystallization and melting occurred, it could be decided in most casesâ€”e. g. on the basis of the difference between the peak maximum temperatures for meltingand crystallization (Tc)â€”what kind of polymercaused the corresponding DSC peaks. Combining the findings with results from FTIR showed these to be complementary and unanimous and to be very useful in order to arrive at the complete picture of molecular structure.

5043,5055,12,"It turned out that in the lower M part of the MMD only propylene crystallinity was present. At intermediate and high M, both ethylene and propylene crystallinities were found to be related to polyethylene varying in propylene content and to polypropylene varying in isotacticity, respectively. With increasing TREF elution temperature the isotacticity of the polypropylene increased appreciably, leading to longer sequences of isotactic polypropylene and concomitant increasing melting temperatures. At the same time cross-fractions showing ethylene crystallinity were seen to be ethyleneâ€“propylene copolymerswith various ethylene and propylene sequence length distributions. With increasing TREF elution temperature their ethylene sequence lengths increased because of the decreasing amount of propylene incorporated in the chains. As can be expected for the present components constituting the impact PP copolymer studied here, the DSC curves resemble metastable states with associated reorganization phenomena including recrystallization. Therefore, though the PerkinElmer DSC 8500 is quite capable to measure at 50 Â°C/min samples having such minute amounts of material as in the present case, to find out to what extent the scan rate is of importance it was varied by taking rates of 5, 50, 100, and 200 Â°C/min. For the same reason, measurements at 10, 100, and 1000 Â°C/s with the Mettler-Toledo flash DSC 1 have also been added. A first and important conclusion from these measurements is that continuity of the Tc and Tm data was found for the HPer DSC and the flash DSC 1. In this scan rate range spanning over 4 decadesâ€”from âˆ¼0. 1 to 1000 Â°C/sâ€”Tc dropped linearly in this restricted area, while the decrease of Tm leveled off at the high scan rates, signifying that the melting process is dominated by fast reorganization processes: too fast for the present instrumentation to be influenced significantly. Crystallization and dissolution measurements with the DSC 8500 on fractions in p-xylene gave useful informationâ€”after correction for recrystallizationâ€”on the lowering of Tc and Tm compared to crystallization and melting without liquid, from and into the melt state, even though the cooling and heating rates were much higher.

5430,5447,17,"Figure 8. PLM micrographs ofneat PE and nanocomposites containing0. 04 vol % and0. 2 vol % of RGO. Crystallization Behavior of PGNsThe influence of 2D RGO sheets on the crystallization behavior of PGNs is of interest. Both nonisothermal and isothermal crystallization behaviors of PGNs were studied by DSC. Figure 9 shows the nonisothermal crystallization/melting behavior of PGNs with different RGO loadings. The first heating curve represents the thermal history of PGNs and is strongly influenced by the fabrication process, while the second heating curve reveals the crystallization of PGNs from melts. An intriguing observation is that two distinct melting peaks are observed on the first heating curves of 0. 04 and 0. 08 vol % PGNs, while PE only has a single melting peak (Figure 9a). The relative intensity of the peak with higher Tm increased as the RGO content increased, whereas the peak with lower Tm diminished and broadened with the increase of RGO content. The melting peak with higher Tm can be explained as a result of the heterogeneous nucleated, better formed PE crystals templated by the RGO sheets during solution crystallization. The increase of RGO concentration provides more sites for polymer to nucleate and grow and thus contributes to higher intensity of the melting peak. During the second heating process in DSC, the crystallization became more uniform in melt, and all PGNs exhibited only one single melting peak (Figure 9b). Figure 9. Nonisothermal DSC scans of PGNs at a constant scanning rate of 10 Â°C/min:first heating,second heating, andcooling.

Combined effects of graphene nanosheetsand shear flow on the crystn. behavior of isotactic polypropylenewere investigated by in-situ synchrotron wide-angle x-ray diffractionand small-angle X-ray scatteringtechniques. For crystn. under quiescent condition (at 145 Â°C), the half-crystn. timeof nanocomposites contg. 0. 05 and 0. 1 wt % GNSs was reduced to at least 50% compared to that of neat iPP, indicating the high nucleation ability of GNSs. The crystn. rate of iPP was directly proportional to the GNS content. Under a relatively weak shear flowand a low degree of supercooling, the neat iPP exhibited an isotropic structure due to the relaxation of row nuclei. However, visible antisotropic crystals appeared in sheared iPP/GNSs nanocomposites, indicating that GNSs induced a network structure hindering the mobility of iPP chains and allowing the survival of oriented row nuclei for a long period of time. The presence of GNSs clearly enhanced the effects of shear-induced nucleation as well as orientation of iPP crystals. Two kinds of nucleating origins coexisted in the sheared nanocomposite melt: heterogeneous nucleating sites initiated by GNSs and homogeneous nucleating sitesinduced by shear. The difference of t1/2 of nanocomposites with and without shear was significantly larger than that of neat iPP. The presence of GNSs and shear flow exhibited a synergistic interaction on promoting crystn.",,ma2021453,1,1,1,0,1,,reference,,,,of the pet spherulitics are not easy to detect in most of microdomains compared with the pure pet the mol chains intercalated in the interlamellae of clay are confined to some extent which will explain the narrow distribution of the nanopet mol wt the stripebelt morphol of the intercalated clay show that polymer pet mol chains are intercalated into the enlarged interlamellar space more from scifinder httpschemport cas orgservicesresolveroriginacsresolutionoptionscoi13acas3a5283adyak1mxksvelsg253d253dmd532aa5f0943c4e5c463c86c99f29a470534 priya l  jog j p j polym sci  part b polym phys 2002 40 1682 1689crossref cas34 polyvinylidene fluorideclay nanocomposites prepared by melt intercalation crystallization and dynamic mechanical behavior studiespriya l  jog j p journal of polymer science part b polymer physics 2002 40 15 16821689 coden jpbpem issn08876266 john wiley  sons inc  the prepn and properties of polypvdfclay nanocomposites are reported for the first time pvdfclay nanocomposites were prepd by melt intercalation with organophilic clay the composites were characterized with xray diffraction differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mech anal xray diffraction results indicated intercalation of the polymer into the interlayer spacing pvdf in the nanocomposites crystd in the  form differential scanning calorimetry nonisothermal curves showed an increase in the melting and crystn temps along with a decrease in crystallinity as evidenced by the melting and crystn peaks isothermal crystn studies showed an enhanced rate of crystn with the addn of clay as evidenced by a redn in the crystn time dynamic mech anal indicated significant improvements in the storage modulus over a temp range of 100 to 150c the tan  peak signifying the glasstransition temp of pvdf shifted to higher temps more from scifinder httpschemport cas orgservicesresolveroriginacsresolutionoptionscoi13acas3a5283adc252bd38xlsvsmtrs253dmd55a0b071ff990b147d674bf75eddbfe9e35 xu j z  chen c  wang y  tang h  li z m  hsiao b s macromolecules 2011 44 2808 2818acs full text  cas35 graphene nanosheets and shear flow induced crystallization in isotactic polypropylene nanocompositesxu jiazhuang chen chen wang yan tang hu li zhongming hsiao benjamin s macromolecules2011 44 8 28082818 coden mamobx issn00249297 combined effects of graphene nanosheetsand shear flow on the crystn behavior of isotactic polypropylenewere investigated by insitu synchrotron wideangle xray diffractionand smallangle xray scatteringtechniques for crystn under quiescent condition at 145 c the halfcrystn timeof nanocomposites contg 0 05 and 0 1 wt  gnss was reduced to at least 50 compared to that of neat ipp indicating the high nucleation ability of gnss the crystn rate of ipp was directly proportional to the gns content under a relatively weak shear flowand a low degree of supercooling the neat ipp exhibited an isotropic structure due to the relaxation of row nuclei however visible antisotropic crystals appeared in sheared ippgnss nanocomposites indicating that gnss induced a network structure hindering the mobility of ipp chains and allowing the survival of oriented row nuclei for a long period of time the presence of gnss clearly enhanced the effects of shearinduced nucleation as well as orientation of ipp crystals two kinds of nucleating origins coexisted in the sheared nanocomposite melt heterogeneous nucleating sites initiated by gnss and homogeneous nucleating sitesinduced by shear the difference of t12 of nanocomposites with and without shear was significantly larger than that of neat ipp the presence of gnss and shear flow exhibited a synergistic interaction on promoting crystn,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96598965, 'word': 'pet', 'start': 7, 'end': 10}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96630806, 'word': 'pet', 'start': 94, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9650293, 'word': 'pet', 'start': 241, 'end': 244}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9668342, 'word': 'pet', 'start': 322, 'end': 325}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.95045394, 'word': 'poly ( vinylidene fluoride )', 'start': 679, 'end': 704}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9472156, 'word': 'poly', 'start': 1001, 'end': 1005}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.80761063, 'word': 'pvdf )', 'start': 1006, 'end': 1011}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9711179, 'word': 'pvdf', 'start': 1065, 'end': 1069}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.5648154, 'word': 'clay', 'start': 1070, 'end': 1074}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96833044, 'word': 'pvdf', 'start': 1359, 'end': 1363}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9715505, 'word': 'pvdf', 'start': 1909, 'end': 1913}]",

SCMHB pendant polymers, poly(Bu acrylate-co-SCMHB methacrylate), were prepd. via free radical copolymn. of Bu acrylateand a novel SCMHB methacrylatemonomer, which was synthesized via a quant. coupling reaction between 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylateand Me isocytosinein DMSO. The glass transition temps. of polyincreased in a linear fashion as the SCMHB MA content increased. Thermogravimetric anal. of the copolymers exhibited an onset of wt. loss at 217 Â°C. Soln. viscosity anal. indicated that SCMHB pendant polymers strongly aggregated in nonpolar solvents, such as toluene and CHCl3, and dissocd. in polar solvents, such as THF. Based on melt rheol. characterization, the melt viscosity of sol. SCMHB pendant polymers was an order of magnitude higher than that of PBA due to strong aggregation in the melt state. SCMHB pendant polymers exhibited thermoreversible characteristics, and complete dissocn. in the melt state was obsd. at 80 Â°C, which was consistent with our earlier studies involving SCMHB-terminated poly(PS), poly(PI), and PS-b-PI block copolymers.

6680,6697,17,"Thermal PropertiesThermal studies were first conducted using TGA to determine the degradation temperature. The six phosphonium ionic liquids possess high thermal stability and only start to decompose when the temperature reaches around 300 Â°C (Figure 2 and Table 1). The three supramolecular ionic liquid/PAA networksand the three ionic liquid/PAA mixturesshowed the same pattern and did not decompose until above 200 Â°C, which is the temperature where PAA starts to degrade (Figure 2). For example, di-HexC10Cl decomposes at 295 Â°C, while both di-HexC10PAA and mono-HexC10PAA have decomposition temperatures around 270 Â°C. The phase behaviors of the neat ionic liquids, ionic liquid/PAA networks, and ionic liquid/PAA mixtures were investigated by DSC (Table 1). After drying all samples under high vacuum with heat overnight, the di-ButC10PAA was the most solid material of the three. A consecutive cooling and heating cycle for di-ButC10PAA revealed a glass transition at 8 Â°C. The glass transition temperature for di-HexC10PAA and di-OctC10PAA was âˆ’18 and âˆ’40 Â°C, respectively, lower than that observed for di-ButC10PAA. A melting temperature was not observed for these compositions within the temperature range tested. Figure 2. TGA profiles of three supramolecular polymeric networksand di-HexC10Cl and PAA as control groups. The thermal behavior of the corresponding ionic liquids and ionic liquid/PAA mixtures were different than the ionic liquid networks. The diphosphonium ionic liquids exhibited melting points observable in the first heating scan, varying from 103 to âˆ’57 Â°C. The subsequent cooling and heating scans revealed glass transitions at 0 and âˆ’30 Â°C for di-ButC10Cl and di-HexC10Cl. No obvious glass transition was observed higher than âˆ’100 Â°C. It should be noted that the crystallization of the di-IL was relatively slow, as the melting points did not reappear in the second or third melting isotherm. The monoionic liquids, Mono-ButC10Cl and mono-OctC10Cl, exhibited a glass transition at âˆ’50 and âˆ’80 Â°C, respectively. Table 1.

DSC Analysis of Dendritic CopolymersDSC measurement was performed to investigate the effects of macromolecular architecture on chain relaxation and melting behaviors (Table S2, Supporting Information). Macromonomers were of melting peaksat 29. 5 Â°C (St-PEG), 32. 7 and 42. 6 Â°C (MI-PCL), respectively. AmBn dendritic comblike copolymerhad weak glass transitionsat 47. 2 and 54. 5 Â°C and melting range within 15. 8â€“44. 9 Â°C with two melting peaks at 19. 0 and 26. 8 Â°C (Figure 8c). Normal AmBn comblike copolymerexhibited obvious glass transitions at 53. 6 and 67. 3 Â°C and melting range within 17. 8â€“43. 8 Â°C with melting peak at 33. 0 Â°C (Figure 8d). Besides different chain length of polybackbones, the branching effect could account for their different thermal properties. Although both DC2 and C1 possessed same PEG and PCL side chains, comblike copolymer C1 had longer linear backbone, while dendritic comblike copolymer DC2 was of branched backbones with a couple of comonomer units in each branch, and thus dendritic comblike copolymer could perform the chain relaxation at reduced temperature. Meanwhile, the presence of more compact branched structures in DC2 was liable to form multiple restricted crystalline and noncrystalline regions in which the folding and rearrangement of PEG and PCL chains were more or less disturbed, resulting in remarkably reduced melting peaks and broadened melting range in dendritic comblike copolymer. AmBnCo dendritic toothbrushlike copolymers have more complex chain relaxation and melting processes than AmBn dendritic comblike copolymers due to their different architectures. In DSC traces, (PEG)m(PCL)n(PtBA)o showed a notable Tg at 16. 9 Â°C, and other AmBnCo samples only exhibited a relatively weak Tg at about 62. 2 (C = PSt), 85. 3and 116. 1 Â°C (C = PNIPAM). These observations were in accordance with our previous results,in which the Tg values of (PM)m multiarm star and linear PM with same Mn values decreased in the order linear PM > star-shaped (PM)m > cleaved PM arm. Interestingly, multiple melting peaks were normally noted in DSC traces of various AmBnCo samples, and the melting range could cover a wide range within 17â€“75 Â°C. This phenomenon could be primarily ascribed to the restricted chain movement during crystallization originating from unique architecture of AmBnCo terpolymers.

Thermal properties of the polymers were investigated via thermal gravimetric anal. and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TGA measurements show that these polymers are stable up to 350Â°. DSC results demonstrate that the glass transition and melting behaviors of the polymers are not only affected by the rigidity of Î³-butyrolactone units in polyethylene chains but also dependent on the methylene spacer length and chain homogeneity. Copolymn. of M6 or M8 with 1,9-decadiene resulted in random copolymers with lower Î³-butyrolactone content and less regular chain structure.

The mol. wts. of the star-shaped polymers were measured by GPC, 1H NMR, and SLS. It was found that the mol. wt. of the synthesized star-shaped polylactides can be controlled by variation of the generation of the dendrimer initiators and the molar ratio of monomer to initiator. Effects of mol. wt. and no. of arms on the thermal properties and hydrolytic degrdn. of the star-shaped polylactides were investigated. For polylactides initiated with the same dendrimer initiator, the melting temp. and crystallinity increased with increasing mol. wt. For star-shaped polylactides initiated with dendrimer initiators with different generations, the m. p. , crystallinity, crystn. rate, and max. decompn. temp. decreased as the no. of arms increased, while the corresponding hydrolysis rate increased.

7909,7918,9,"Trifluoromethyl is a very useful functional group, known to provide even lower surface tension than PTFE. When used in polyesters, polyamides, and polyaramids, the resulting fluorinated (co)polymers were found to possess increased repellency to water and oil. We have recently built on the synthetic design capability of these materials to prepare blocky fluorinated/nonfluorinated aromatic copolyesters derived from a commercially attractive melt process, a feature not typical for polycondensation polymers. As background, Wallace Carotherâ€™s pioneering research on step growth polycondensation was the onset for the development of engineering polymers in the 20th century. Whereas Carothers and co-workers outlined synthetic routes to polyesters, polyamides, and others, Flory later coupled experimental observations to theoretical considerations. Indeed, one of the fundamental features of polycondensation is that of equal reactivity between functional groups at all stages of the polymerization. There are several implications. For one, it is difficult to control the molecular weight or the molecular weight distribution of the formed polymer (PDI âˆ¼ 2. 0 for a polycondensation process). This can be understood by the fact that monomers, without discrimination, readily react with other monomers, oligomers, or polymers. Another implication of equal reactivity is that a selected molecular structure, e. g. , sequences of specific monomer units along the chain, is hard to achieve. If one, for example, would polymerize isophthalic and terephthalic acid in equal proportions together with one particular glycol, for example ethylene glycol, this would render a random copolymer structure in which isophthalate and terephthalate units would randomly appear along the polymer backbone.",,ma3011075,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,0,trifluoromethyl is a very useful functional group known to provide even lower surface tension than ptfe when used in polyesters polyamides and polyaramids the resulting fluorinated copolymers were found to possess increased repellency to water and oil we have recently built on the synthetic design capability of these materials to prepare blocky fluorinatednonfluorinated aromatic copolyesters derived from a commercially attractive melt process a feature not typical for polycondensation polymers as background wallace carothers pioneering research on step growth polycondensation was the onset for the development of engineering polymers in the 20th century whereas carothers and coworkers outlined synthetic routes to polyesters polyamides and others flory later coupled experimental observations to theoretical considerations indeed one of the fundamental features of polycondensation is that of equal reactivity between functional groups at all stages of the polymerization there are several implications for one it is difficult to control the molecular weight or the molecular weight distribution of the formed polymer pdi  2 0 for a polycondensation process this can be understood by the fact that monomers without discrimination readily react with other monomers oligomers or polymers another implication of equal reactivity is that a selected molecular structure e g  sequences of specific monomer units along the chain is hard to achieve if one for example would polymerize isophthalic and terephthalic acid in equal proportions together with one particular glycol for example ethylene glycol this would render a random copolymer structure in which isophthalate and terephthalate units would randomly appear along the polymer backbone,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7892436, 'word': 'ptfe', 'start': 100, 'end': 104}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.68915707, 'word': 'polyesters', 'start': 119, 'end': 129}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.71259016, 'word': 'polyamides', 'start': 131, 'end': 141}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.655173, 'word': 'polyaramid', 'start': 147, 'end': 157}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.66980016, 'word': 'polyesters', 'start': 739, 'end': 749}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.69368994, 'word': 'polyamides', 'start': 751, 'end': 761}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.7592912, 'word': 'pdi', 'start': 1152, 'end': 1155}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.8432639, 'word': '2. 0', 'start': 1160, 'end': 1164}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.57794607, 'word': 'isophthalic', 'start': 1530, 'end': 1541}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.5843949, 'word': 'terephthalic acid', 'start': 1546, 'end': 1563}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.5538072, 'word': 'isophthal', 'start': 1707, 'end': 1716}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.56629914, 'word': 'terephthalate', 'start': 1724, 'end': 1737}]",2. 0

Results indicate that the thermal characteristics of the two starting components are retained in the copolymer, i. e. the Tg from the fluorinated component is observed at âˆ¼18 Â°C and Tg and Tm from the PTT component are observed at 54 and 219 Â°C, respectively. The Tg of the fluorinated componentis about 10 Â°C higher compared to the homo 3-GF16-iso oligomer (Tgâˆ¼8 Â°C). The increase in Tg is ascribed to the fact that the chain ends now are incorporated into the copolymer and that this restriction in mobility leads to a slightly higher onset in translational mobility. Similarly, the Tm of the PTT component is âˆ¼10 Â°C lower compared to the neat polymer, due to the incorporation of the softer fluorinated component. As already described, the fully amorphous or random/statistical copolymer only shows a single Tg âˆ¼ 23 Â°C (Table 1). Thus, overall findings suggest a blocky type of copolymer. In fact, the thermal characteristics are typical of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEâ€™s), which may explain the observed elastic properties of the resulting material. In Table 3 are summarized the thermal characteristics of the homo- and copolymers, either random or blocky. Figure 11.

(John Wiley & Sons, Inc. ) Taking advantage of a melt polycondensation process, a series of copolyesters composed of pure terephthalate acid (PTA), ethylene glycol (EG), and 1,3-propanediolwere synthesized. The component, mol. wt. , mol. wt. distribution, and thermal properties of the copolymers were characterized. The results show that the contents of trimethylene terephthalateunits in the resulting copolyesters are higher than PDO compns. in original diol. Oligomer content in the copolyesters varies with the compns. and attains a min. value when the TT ingredient is 49. 52 mol %. The glass transition temp. of the copolyesters varies from 78. 5Â°C for PETto 43. 5Â°C for PTTand decreases monotonically with the components. The copolyesters are amorphous copolymers when TT content is in the range of 32. 4-40. 8 mol %, as calcd. from the melting enthalpymeasured via differential scanning calorimetry.

The working pressure was between 1. 8 and 2. 2 Ã— 10â€“3 mbar. Precursor 4 (0. 50 g) was sublimed at 135 Â°Cand the vapor was led through a quartz glass tube maintained between 420 and 580 Â°Cwhere the corresponding quinodimethanes formed, heating zone 3 was set to 300 Â°C. In the deposition chamber, a borosilicate glass chamber with a cooling jacket, the reactive monomer gas polymerized spontaneously to form the desired siloxane containing polymer on the chamber walls, which were maintained at 0 Â°C. For GPC measurements the polymer was used without further purification. For thermo analysis, mechanical and NMR measurements the polymer was dissolved in chloroform, precipitated in methanol and then dried for 48 h at 15 mbar and 60 Â°C. 2. 5Characterization of 5eYield: 100% substance in deposition chamber, 69% after reprecipitation in methanolIR: Î½= 2955 (m), 1497 (w), 1447 (w), 1413 (w), 1252 (s), 1169 (w), 1047 (s), 833 (s), 802 (s), 785 (m), 687 (w), 631 (w). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): Î´= 7. 36â€“6. 64 (m, 3H), 3. 05â€“2. 41 (m, 5. 6H), 1. 37 (bs, 0. 9H), 0. 89 (bs, 1. 3H), 0. 29 to âˆ’0. 17 (m, 15H). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): Î´= 143. 4, 142. 9, 140. 1, 136. 89, 129. 2, 129. 0, 128. 6, 127. 2, 125. 8, 124. 4, 38. 0, 37. 8, 35. 6, 34. 9, 34. 1, 26. 2, 20. 5, 15. 9, 2. 1, 1. 9, 0. 3, âˆ’0. 9.

11472,11483,11,", A 2003, 216167â€“ 173[CrossRef], [CAS]10. The facile surface modification of polyultrathin filmsSenkevich, Jay J. ; Yang, G. -R. ; Lu, T. -M. Colloids and Surfaces, A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects (2003), 216 (1-3), 167-173 CODEN: CPEAEH; ISSN:0927-7757. (Elsevier Science B. V. ) The parylene polymers studied here are vacuum deposited by a common but unique method that is self-initiating and unterminating. The lack of chain termination allows the chain endings of the polymers to react with atm. O and 50% aq. ammonium sulfide. However, the latter reaction in particular can only take place at the polymer's surface due to the excellent barrier properties of the parylenes, which leaves the surface of parylene hydroxyl terminated and consequently hydrophilic. High parylene polymer typically cannot be easily modified since few chain ends exist at its surface; however, this is in contrast to ultrathin oligomeric parylene films. The surface chem. of the modified and annealed ultrathin parylene films was undertaken with XPS and contact angle goniometry. Results show that as-deposited ultrathin parylene filmsreact with atm. Odue to a rather large O1s peak and asymmetry in the Cls spectrum due to C-O bonding. The ultrathin film also exhibits a precipitous drop in its contact angle after exposure to 50% ammonium sulfide.

Pure PBT samples were annealed in a vacuum oven at 200 Â°C for 2 and 5 h, to obtain samples with different degrees of crystallinity. The tensile properties were characterized using a Rheometric System Analyzer (RSA-III, TA Instruments), at a constant extension rate of 0. 001 mm/s at room temperature. The rectangular sample dimensions were 25 Ã— 5 Ã— 0. 7 mm. A new sample was used for each tensile test. 2. 5 Thermal Analysis Differential scanning calorimetrystudies were conducted using a TA InstrumentsDSC model Q1000 focusing on the specimens of pure PBT and PBT nanocomposites. During differential scanning calorimetry the specimenswere ramped from 25 to 255 Â°C and kept at 255 Â°C for ten minutes and were then cooled back down to 25 Â°C. The heating and cooling rates were 10 Â°C/min. Typical DSC scans of pure PBT obtained upon heating and cooling are shown in Figure 4. The temperatures associated with the onset of the melting, Tm,o, the melting temperature Tm (defined as the highest temperature at which the last trace of crystallinity disappears during heating), and the crystallization onset temperature, Tc,oare shown in the Figure 4. The nominal melting temperaturewas defined as the peak of the melting endotherm during heating from 25 to 255 Â°C, and the nominal crystallization temperaturewas defined as the peak of the crystallization exotherm upon cooling from 255 to 25 Â°C. The degree of crystallinity, Xc (i. e. , the weight fraction crystallinity), was determined as the ratio of the integrated heat of fusion value of the sample over the heat of fusion of purely crystalline PBT, i. e. , 140 J/g:Figure 4.

The results of crystallization under quiescent conditions obtained with DSC suggest that even in the absence of shear and at relatively minor concentrations of MWNTs, there are noteworthy changes in the dynamics of the crystallization process and the ultimate crystallinity values attained for PBT upon the incorporation of the MWNTs. Overall, there are only modest reductions, i. e. , 2âˆ’6 Â°C in the melting temperatures with 0. 5 to 2% by volume MWNTs. On the other hand, there are significant increases in the crystallinity upon the incorporation of the MWNTs; for example, the degree of crystallinity under constant cooling rate increases from 20. 7% for pure PBT to 24. 5% for PBT incorporated with 2% by volume MWNTs.

For example, the temperature at which crystallization is onset, Tc,o, increases by about 22 Â°C and the peak crystallization temperature, Tc,p, increases by 29. 4 Â°C with only 0. 5% by volume of MWNTs (Table 1). Additional increases in the concentration of the MWNTs generate only modest additional increases in the crystallization temperature. These DSC results obtained for crystallization under quiescent conditions that suggest that the crystallization temperature of the polymer is significantly affected upon the incorporation of the nanoparticles are in agreement with the quiescent crystallization results obtained for polypropyleneincorporated with SWNTs. Similar changes in melting behavior under quiescent conditions have also been observed for PP incorporated with MWNTsand PLLA compounded with nanoclays. The observed increase of the crystallinity of the PBT upon the incorporation of the MWNTs observed here is again in agreement with the increase of crystallinity of other polymers incorporated with

Further support to this hypothesis is provided below in the discussion of the shear-induced crystallization behavior of PBT and its nanocomposites, where it will be shown that additional significant gains in crystallinity are obtained upon the shear-induced crystallization of the PBT in the presence of carbon nanotubes. 3. 2 Effect of MWNTs on Shear-Induced Crystallization Behavior of PBT Linear viscoelastic material functions are very sensitive to structural changes in the polymer melt and can provide information on changes in the physicochemical properties of the polymer during deformation. For example, for thermally sensitive polymer melts, an irreversible decrease in viscosity with time at a constant shear rate suggests the possibility of thermal degradation of polymer molecules, whereas an irreversible increase in viscosity with time suggests the possibility of chemical cross-linking between polymer molecules. Both thermal degradation and chemical cross-linking are irreversible in the rheological responses they generate. On the other hand, sudden increases in the linear viscoelastic properties with time during shearing under constant deformation conditions at temperatures which are greater than the quiescent crystallization temperature of the pure melt suggest the flow-induced crystallization of the polymer melt upon shearing. Thus, upon shear-induced crystallization unbounded monotonic increases in the storage moduli (Gâ€²), loss moduli (Gâ€²â€²), and magnitude of complex viscosity |Î·*| with time are observed. Pennings and co-workers have documented that the morphology of such crystals formed upon shearing is typically of the â€œshish kebabâ€ type and is thus very different than the typical row-nucleated and spherulitic morphologies that are generally observed under quiescent crystallization from the melt. Figure 5 shows the typical shear-induced crystallization results obtained for the dynamic properties versus time for PBT, MWNT-PBT nanocomposites and graphite-PBT composite samples collected at a constant frequency of 5 rps and 1% strain amplitude at 215 Â°C. As shown in Figure 5a, an increase in Gâ€² with time was observed for MWNT-PBT nanocomposites that was not observed for pure PBT and graphite-PBT under similar conditions. This indicates a sharp increase in the crystallization rate due to the incorporation of MWNTs into PBT.",,ma8008838,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,0,5 by volume could be an additional major contributing factor giving rise to the significant property enhancements of polymeric nanocomposites further support to this hypothesis is provided below in the discussion of the shearinduced crystallization behavior of pbt and its nanocomposites where it will be shown that additional significant gains in crystallinity are obtained upon the shearinduced crystallization of the pbt in the presence of carbon nanotubes 3 2 effect of mwnts on shearinduced crystallization behavior of pbt linear viscoelastic material functions are very sensitive to structural changes in the polymer melt and can provide information on changes in the physicochemical properties of the polymer during deformation for example for thermally sensitive polymer melts an irreversible decrease in viscosity with time at a constant shear rate suggests the possibility of thermal degradation of polymer molecules whereas an irreversible increase in viscosity with time suggests the possibility of chemical crosslinking between polymer molecules both thermal degradation and chemical crosslinking are irreversible in the rheological responses they generate on the other hand sudden increases in the linear viscoelastic properties with time during shearing under constant deformation conditions at temperatures which are greater than the quiescent crystallization temperature of the pure melt suggest the flowinduced crystallization of the polymer melt upon shearing thus upon shearinduced crystallization unbounded monotonic increases in the storage moduli g loss moduli g and magnitude of complex viscosity  with time are observed pennings and coworkers have documented that the morphology of such crystals formed upon shearing is typically of the shish kebab type and is thus very different than the typical rownucleated and spherulitic morphologies that are generally observed under quiescent crystallization from the melt figure 5 shows the typical shearinduced crystallization results obtained for the dynamic properties versus time for pbt mwntpbt nanocomposites and graphitepbt composite samples collected at a constant frequency of 5 rps and 1 strain amplitude at 215 c as shown in figure 5a an increase in g with time was observed for mwntpbt nanocomposites that was not observed for pure pbt and graphitepbt under similar conditions this indicates a sharp increase in the crystallization rate due to the incorporation of mwnts into pbt,"[{'entity_group': 'MATERIAL_AMOUNT', 'score': 0.6920459, 'word': '5 %', 'start': 0, 'end': 2}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9248719, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 265, 'end': 268}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.92341524, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 426, 'end': 429}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.8067695, 'word': 'carbon nanotubes', 'start': 449, 'end': 465}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.7634959, 'word': 'mwnts', 'start': 482, 'end': 487}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.92962754, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 533, 'end': 536}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9174788, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2108, 'end': 2111}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.864316, 'word': 'mwnt', 'start': 2113, 'end': 2117}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.8645891, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2118, 'end': 2121}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.8416149, 'word': 'graphite', 'start': 2141, 'end': 2149}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.8258548, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2150, 'end': 2153}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.86619496, 'word': 'mwnt', 'start': 2321, 'end': 2325}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.88568354, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2326, 'end': 2329}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.8778729, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2376, 'end': 2379}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.81748235, 'word': 'graphite', 'start': 2384, 'end': 2392}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7442533, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2393, 'end': 2396}, {'entity_group': 'INORGANIC', 'score': 0.7710955, 'word': 'mwnts', 'start': 2511, 'end': 2516}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.92149913, 'word': 'pbt', 'start': 2522, 'end': 2525}]",

Independent of blend ratio, the strong streak attributed to extended-chain crystalsappeared on the equator at the beginning point of the plateau stress region in the stress profile, which was one of the characteristic features of melt-drawing. A series of detailed analyses of these streaks suggested that two components with different dimensions were formed during melt-drawing: one was a precursory ECC, and the other was a mature ECC. These two ECC components grew synchronously at the beginning point of the plateau stress region for both films, independent of the entanglement characteristics of the film. However, the time of this synchronized growth was longer for the film with the lower MW component than for the film contg. only the higher MW component. The resultant morphologies of the melt-drawn samples obsd. by transmission electron microscopy also reflected these characteristics. These results demonstrate that mol. entanglement characteristics dominate the unique crystn. mechanism that forms ECCs with different dimensions during melt-drawing of UHMW-PE.

Journal of Applied Polymer Science (1986), 31 (6), 1595-607 CODEN: JAPNAB; ISSN:0021-8995. The relationships between the drawing and annealing conditions of melt-spun poly[24968-12-5] filaments and the resulting structure and mech. properties were detd. The relative amt. of Î²-form crystal content increased with increasing draw ratio and was directly proportional to the drawing stress for a given draw ratio. As drawing stress decreased with increasing draw temp. , the Î² content decreased rapidly with increasing draw temp. Annealing reduced the amt. of Î²-phase but increased the Î±-phase content and crystallinity. The effect of these structural variations on the mech. properties was examd. The mech. properties were very sensitive to the structure of the filaments and, hence, to the processing conditions.

Polypropylene, melted at 250Â° and cooled to 140Â°, crystallizes slowly and only a few spherulites are formed. Application of a 0. 1 kg. /cm. 2 shear-stress results in abundant nucleation of small spherulites in long rows parallel to the direction of shear. Heavy strains are introduced when the polypropylene is milled at 180Â° on a 2-roll mill and later quenched. A microscopic specimen made at 200Â° from quenched milled sheet and cooled slowly showed sharp birefringent lines which gradually increase in no. and birefringence. These lines are visible above the normal m. p. of the polypropylene. At a low d. of these lines, normal fibrillar outgrowths called nucleation lines are seen. After heating above 210Â°, the d. of nucleation lines on cooling decreases. On heating at 240Â° for 1 min. , the lines completely disappear. For material of higher intrinsic viscosity, a higher temp. is necessary in order to bring about complete disappearance of orientation-induced nucleation.

It is an exceptional material because of its excellent mechanical properties, such as high tensile strength and remarkable impact strength, which all result from the high degree of crystallization. Furthermore, POM is stable over a broad temperature range up to 220 Â°C, exhibits low moisture absorption, and is resistant to most organic solvents and water. However, due to the polyacetal repeating units, the POM homopolymer is temperature- and acid labile and degrades slowly under formaldehyde release. To prevent the underlying â€œunzippingâ€ mechanism, trioxane is copolymerized with cyclic ethers, e. g. , ethylene oxide, 1,3-dioxolane, 1,3-dioxepane, or comparable structures. In this case, unzipping can still occur, but degradation stops as soon as the polyacetal structure is interrupted by a Câ€“C-bond of the respective comonomer. The copolymerization affects the degree of crystallization of POM, resulting in a lower melting temperature and decreased mechanical properties. On the other hand, the decreased melting temperature improves processability and opens up a broad application spectrum for this material, for instance in bearings, gear wheels, and housing parts that are often exposed to extremely high loads.

Figure 3. SECtraces of the POM450 macroinitiator and the corresponding ABA triblock copolymers. Thermal Properties and Degree of CrystallizationThe thermal properties of the block copolymers have been investigated via differential scanning calorimetryand thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). POM shows a melting range from 175 to 185 Â°C for homopolymersand melting temperatures around 165 Â°C for copolymers in dependence of the 1,3-dioxolane content. For instance, a linear copolymer with 4% ethylene glycol units exhibits a Tm at 161. 7 Â°C, whereas a copolymer with 5% ethylene glycol units shows a Tm at 162. 4 Â°C. The glass transition temperatureis observed at âˆ’82 Â°C. In contrast, hbPG displays a Tg at around âˆ’20 Â°C, depending on molecular weight and the number of free hydroxyl groups. Figure 4 shows several DSC traces of linear POM structure and the corresponding triblock copolymers with increasing molecular weight of the hbPG blocks. Figure 4. DSC graphs for POM450 macroinitiator and the corresponding triblock copolymers. As expected, the hbPG-b-POM-b-hbPG copolymers show lowered melting temperatures compared to the respective linear POM structures, ranging from 147. 6 to 159. 9 Â°C (Table 2). For the triblock copolymer with a POM content of 85. 9 mol %, there is no glass transition observable. It is interesting to note that the additional hbPG blocks exert no significant influence on the thermal properties of POM. For a POM content of 82. 0 mol %, a Tg of âˆ’46. 4 Â°C appears, which increases to âˆ’27. 1 Â°C for 74. 6 mol % relative POM content and decreases again to âˆ’37. 1 Â°C for 60. 3 mol % relative POM content. To conclude, with increasing content of hbPG, the Tg of this block is detectable, but no correlation of hbPG block size and Tg is observable, most likely due to the dependence of the Tg not only on molecular weight, but also on degree of branching and number of free hydroxyl groups. For comparison, a blend of POM450 and hbPG14 was also measured by DSC showing a melting point of 161. 7 Â°C and a glass transition at âˆ’33. 5 Â°C, which correlates to the POM melting temperature and a homopolymer hbPG glass transition. Thus, the different thermal behavior observed for the triblock copolymers represents an additional proof for the successful block formation and covalent linkage between hbPG and POM. The DSC graphs for samples hbPG13-b-POM200-b-hbPG13 and hbPG68-b-POM200-b-hbPG68 are shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information, demonstrating a shift of the Tm to lower temperatures and the appearance of a Tg with increasing hbPG content. For increasing hbPG content, the melting enthalpy decreases from 138. 0 to 90. 2 J gâ€“1. From these values the normalized crystalline fractioncan be calculated by dividing the melting enthalpyby the melting enthalpy for POMwith hypothetical degree of crystallization of 100%and the relative fraction of POM(eq 1). In this manner, the decrease of the crystallizable POM fraction is taken into account, i. e. , the degree of crystallization is normalized to the actual POM content in the materials. The theoretical melting enthalpy for 100% crystalline POMis 326. 3 J gâ€“1. However, commercially available POM usually exhibits a degree of crystallization around 65%. In our case, the degree of crystallization for the POM200 macroinitiator containing 95% trioxane and 5% 1,3-dioxolane is 43.",,ma4015565,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,important context,,,1,composition nmrmnag mol1mnbg mol1mwmnb1pom2006100131001 952hbpg3bpom200bhbpg3660012 3002 013hbpg13bpom200bhbpg13800018 5001 494hbpg14bpom200bhbpg14820018 8001 465hbpg46bpom200bhbpg4612 90022 0001 316hbpg56bpom200bhbpg5614 50022 3001 347hbpg68bpom200bhbpg6816 10022 1001 338pom45013900134001 819hbpg15bpom450bhbpg1516 10013 8001 8110hbpg20bpom450bhbpg2016 90018 5001 4011hbpg31bpom450bhbpg3118 50014 5001 7012hbpg60bpom450bhbpg6022 90013 1001 32acalculated from 1h nmr spectra bdetermined by sec in hfip ridetector signal pmma standards figure 3 sectraces of the pom450 macroinitiator and the corresponding aba triblock copolymers thermal properties and degree of crystallizationthe thermal properties of the block copolymers have been investigated via differential scanning calorimetryand thermogravimetric analysis tga pom shows a melting range from 175 to 185 c for homopolymersand melting temperatures around 165 c for copolymers in dependence of the 13dioxolane content for instance a linear copolymer with 4 ethylene glycol units exhibits a tm at 161 7 c whereas a copolymer with 5 ethylene glycol units shows a tm at 162 4 c the glass transition temperatureis observed at 82 c in contrast hbpg displays a tg at around 20 c depending on molecular weight and the number of free hydroxyl groups figure 4 shows several dsc traces of linear pom structure and the corresponding triblock copolymers with increasing molecular weight of the hbpg blocks figure 4 dsc graphs for pom450 macroinitiator and the corresponding triblock copolymers as expected the hbpgbpombhbpg copolymers show lowered melting temperatures compared to the respective linear pom structures ranging from 147 6 to 159 9 c table 2 for the triblock copolymer with a pom content of 85 9 mol  there is no glass transition observable it is interesting to note that the additional hbpg blocks exert no significant influence on the thermal properties of pom for a pom content of 82 0 mol  a tg of 46 4 c appears which increases to 27 1 c for 74 6 mol  relative pom content and decreases again to 37 1 c for 60 3 mol  relative pom content to conclude with increasing content of hbpg the tg of this block is detectable but no correlation of hbpg block size and tg is observable most likely due to the dependence of the tg not only on molecular weight but also on degree of branching and number of free hydroxyl groups for comparison a blend of pom450 and hbpg14 was also measured by dsc showing a melting point of 161 7 c and a glass transition at 33 5 c which correlates to the pom melting temperature and a homopolymer hbpg glass transition thus the different thermal behavior observed for the triblock copolymers represents an additional proof for the successful block formation and covalent linkage between hbpg and pom the dsc graphs for samples hbpg13bpom200bhbpg13 and hbpg68bpom200bhbpg68 are shown in figure s6 of the supporting information demonstrating a shift of the tm to lower temperatures and the appearance of a tg with increasing hbpg content for increasing hbpg content the melting enthalpy decreases from 138 0 to 90 2 j g1 from these values the normalized crystalline fractioncan be calculated by dividing the melting enthalpyby the melting enthalpy for pomwith hypothetical degree of crystallization of 100and the relative fraction of pomeq 1 in this manner the decrease of the crystallizable pom fraction is taken into account i e  the degree of crystallization is normalized to the actual pom content in the materials the theoretical melting enthalpy for 100 crystalline pomis 326 3 j g1 however commercially available pom usually exhibits a degree of crystallization around 65 in our case the degree of crystallization for the pom200 macroinitiator containing 95 trioxane and 5 13dioxolane is 43,"[{'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.7737317, 'word': 'mna / g mola', 'start': 17, 'end': 27}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.47226596, 'word': '##nb', 'start': 31, 'end': 33}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.8129026, 'word': 'g mola', 'start': 34, 'end': 40}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9551935, 'word': '##hbpg3 -

The triblock copolymer shows a higher degradation temperature than the POM macroinitiator, starting at 380 Â°C. The slight degradation already observed at 200 Â°C can be explained by the initial degradation of unconverted POM macroinitiator. The degradation of POM commences at 220 Â°C, which is in line with literature values (245 Â°C). For hbPG homopolymers degradation temperatures between 320 and 440 Â°Cwere observed. These results suggest that the combination of hbPG blocks with POM increases the thermal stability compared to POM homopolymers, which opens options for applications that require a combination of high mechanical strength with thermal stability, e. g. , in construction and aircraft technologies.

Two model samples are investigated: a melt crystd. sample prepd. by injection molding and a sample obtained by crystn. from dil. soln. Our investigations reveal that, for both samples, there is an increase in cryst. motions and in the amorphous content on heating.

We use SAXS to probe the semicryst. morphol. for the samples on heating and show that, for the molded sample, there is a distribution of lamellar thickness at room temp. and that the thin lamellae in this distribution melt on heating. In contrast to the behavior of the melt crystd. samples, the soln. crystals exhibit no change in the lamellar stacking on heating to 150 Â°C. We also demonstrate that, on heating, the amorphous regions in the soln. crystals always appear to have restricted mobility while there are mobile and low mobility amorphous regions in the molded samples. Our results suggest that, contrary to conventional belief, the decrease in modulus on heating polyoxymethylene arises not from motions in the cryst. lamellae but primarily from melting of thin lamellae.

There is mainly mech. interaction and slight softening at 8 MPa (relatively high friction, low wear), softening at 16 to 55 MPaand finally melting at 150 MPa (very low friction, overload wear). At low contact pressures, wear debris remains amorphous and degrdn. of noncrystd. material during sliding manifests in broadening of the melting peak below the melting temp. Degrdn. of C-O-C due to chain scission and radical reactions into CH3 end groups are illustrated by Raman spectra. It is confirmed that the debris has long resident times and the max. polymer surface temp. is below the crystn. temp. At intermediate contact pressures, crystn. results in a polymer fraction with higher thermal resistance. From the calcd. temps. T* = 120 to 150Â°C, crystn. is beneficial for coherent transfer with larger particle sizes. At high contact pressures, the wear debris is immediately removed from the contact interface due to meltingand has thermal properties similar to the bulk material. There is no reaction between the debris in the interface, resulting in a thick polymer transfer film.

Surprisingly, the solvent quality for PE does not seem to play a major role for CNT modification with SEM triblock terpolymers. Despite the higher melting point of the PE block in 1,4-dioxane (Tm = 79 Â°C),the energy input from sonication is high enough to melt the formed spherical crystalline-core micellesof SEM1 and, thus, provides unimers adsorbing on the CNT surface.

The thermal behavior of polyurethane 6 was studied by DSC; the thermogram corresponding to the first heating cycle showed a broad endotherm of melting (Tm = 212 Â°C, Î”H = 63. 6 J/g). The width of this transition suggested a disperse population of crystallites sizes, as observed for polymers that precipitate from a solution. When the endset of the melting was reached (220 Â°C), the sample was cooled to room temperature and then subjected to a second heating cycle. The thermogram recorded for the cooling process showed a glass transition (Tg = 64 Â°C), but no other thermal transitions took place. During the second heating cycle only the glass transition was observed. Therefore, polyurethane 6 does not crystallize from the melting, upon rapid cooling. The TGA trace for the polyurethane 6 indicated that decomposition started at 240 Â°C. From the TGA curve, plotted in the differential form, the temperature of decompositionwas determined as the maximum of the peak. As the hydroxyl groups of polymer 6 are protected as acetal derivatives that are labile to acids, the hydrolysis of such protecting groups was attempted in order to obtain a polyhydroxylated [n]-polyurethane.","[{'melting_points': [{'value': '212', 'units': 'Â°C'}]}]",ma9014643,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,family of polymers polyurethane 6,,,1,the polymer obtained from the preparative scale showed a weightaverage molecular weightof 20 170 with a polydispersity of 1 8 table 2 properties of npolyurethanes 6 and 8polyurethanemwamnamwmnadtmb htdc620 17011 2301 814 7212 63 6315816 60012 8601 3103 2225 139 3247ameasured by gpc with thf as solvent relative to polystyrene standards bdetermined by dsc temperature in c h in j g1 cdetermined by tg temperature in c the thermal behavior of polyurethane 6 was studied by dsc the thermogram corresponding to the first heating cycle showed a broad endotherm of melting tm  212 c h  63 6 jg the width of this transition suggested a disperse population of crystallites sizes as observed for polymers that precipitate from a solution when the endset of the melting was reached 220 c the sample was cooled to room temperature and then subjected to a second heating cycle the thermogram recorded for the cooling process showed a glass transition tg  64 c but no other thermal transitions took place during the second heating cycle only the glass transition was observed therefore polyurethane 6 does not crystallize from the melting upon rapid cooling the tga trace for the polyurethane 6 indicated that decomposition started at 240 c from the tga curve plotted in the differential form the temperature of decompositionwas determined as the maximum of the peak as the hydroxyl groups of polymer 6 are protected as acetal derivatives that are labile to acids the hydrolysis of such protecting groups was attempted in order to obtain a polyhydroxylated npolyurethane,"[{'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.9109114, 'word': 'weight - average molecular weight', 'start': 57, 'end': 88}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.9631107, 'word': '20 170', 'start': 91, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.85953516, 'word': 'polydispersity', 'start': 106, 'end': 120}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.8942141, 'word': '1. 8', 'start': 124, 'end': 128}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.40764976, 'word': '[ n ]', 'start': 153, 'end': 156}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.5508208, 'word': '- polyureth', 'start': 156, 'end': 166}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.39831325, 'word': '##anes', 'start': 166, 'end': 170}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.47233367, 'word': '##pol', 'start': 178, 'end': 181}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.5407307, 'word': '##y', 'start': 181, 'end': 182}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.45913604, 'word': '##urethane', 'start': 182, 'end': 190}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.616735, 'word': '##11 2301. 8a', 'start': 226, 'end': 237}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.6689425, 'word': '14. 7212 ( 63. 6 ) 315816 60012 8601. 3a', 'start': 239, 'end': 276}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.70140433, 'word': '103. 2225 ( 139. 3 )', 'start': 278, 'end': 296}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.5157429, 'word': 'polyureth', 'start': 492, 'end': 501}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.43382508, 'word': '##ane 6', 'start': 501, 'end': 506}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.8527713, 'word': 'tm', 'start': 620, 'end': 622}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.9437952, 'word': '212 a°c', 'start': 625, 'end': 632}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.78357154, 'word': 'i ” h', 'start': 634, 'end': 637}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.9045897, 'word': '63. 6 j / g', 'start': 640, 'end': 649}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.58841336, 'word': '220 a', 'start': 839, 'end': 844}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.9089197, 'word': 'tg', 'start': 1012, 'end': 1014}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.94568324, 'word': '64 a°c', 'start': 1017, 'end': 1023}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.49049425, 'word': 'polyureth', 'start': 1154, 'end': 1163}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.41955802, 'word': '##ane', 'start': 1163, 'end': 1166}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.53866917, 'word': 'polyureth', 'start': 1250, 'end': 1259}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.4018872, 'word': '##ane', 'start': 1259, 'end': 1262}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.3999996, 'word': '[ n ]', 'start': 1634, 'end': 1637}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.5519629, 'word': '- polyurethane', 'start': 1637, 'end': 1650}]","20 170, 1. 8, ##11 2301. 8a, 14. 7212 ( 63. 6 ) 315816 60012 8601. 3a, 103. 2225 ( 139. 3 ), 212 a°c, 63. 6 j / g, 220 a, 64 a°c"

The narrower melting range of 8 compared to that of 6 suggested a higher degree of crystallinity for 8, which could be the result of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains in 8.

Its melting point is about 136 Â°C. The corresponding yield (ca. 80%) was higher than that obtained when piperidine was used as the base to prepare the 1,1,3,3-tetracyanopropane as claimed by Bomogolova et al. VCN is moisture sensitive, and polymerizes readily upon contact with water at room temperature to form a hard, white, and nonmeltable polymer. Many efforts to stabilize vinylidene cyanide have been developed. The control of the time of this reaction is very important because the 1,1,3,3-tetracyanopropane intermediately can react with the baseto obtain the corresponding carbanion which can further react with the nonreacted formaldehyde leading to secondary compounds that have high melting points. At the end of the distillation, VCN monomer was kept at âˆ’18 Â°C in the presence of a small amount of phosphorus pentoxide, and under nitrogen.",,ma9002165,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,1,top of pageabstractintroductionexperimental partresults and discussionconclusionreferencesexperimental part materials vinylidene cyanidewas prepared by the pyrolysis of 1133tetracyanopropane at 180250 c as detailed elsewhere 1133tetracyanopropane is prepared in the first step using the knovenagel reaction from formaldehyde and malonitrile as a compound possessing mobile hydrogen in the presence of alanin as a base its melting point is about 136 c the corresponding yield ca 80 was higher than that obtained when piperidine was used as the base to prepare the 1133tetracyanopropane as claimed by bomogolova et al vcn is moisture sensitive and polymerizes readily upon contact with water at room temperature to form a hard white and nonmeltable polymer many efforts to stabilize vinylidene cyanide have been developed the control of the time of this reaction is very important because the 1133tetracyanopropane intermediately can react with the baseto obtain the corresponding carbanion which can further react with the nonreacted formaldehyde leading to secondary compounds that have high melting points at the end of the distillation vcn monomer was kept at 18 c in the presence of a small amount of phosphorus pentoxide and under nitrogen,"[{'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.7619989, 'word': '1, 1, 3, 3 - tetracyanopropane', 'start': 169, 'end': 194}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.7332731, 'word': '1, 1, 3, 3 - tetracyanopropane', 'start': 236, 'end': 261}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.895398, 'word': 'melting point', 'start': 443, 'end': 456}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.94811124, 'word': '136 a°c', 'start': 466, 'end': 473}, {'entity_group': 'MATERIAL_AMOUNT', 'score': 0.5103444, 'word': '80', 'start': 504, 'end': 506}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.7092562, 'word': '1, 1, 3, 3 - tetracyanopropane', 'start': 591, 'end': 616}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.562791, 'word': '1, 1, 3, 3 - tetracyanoprop', 'start': 929, 'end': 951}]",136 a°c
15671,15694,23,"Table 3 allows us to suggest the following series of relative reactivities of monomers to ã€°VCNâ€¢ radicals: Maleic anhydride < cis-dichloroethylene â‰ˆ trans-dichloroethylene < vinyl choride < acrylic acid <2-chloroprene â‰ˆ ethyl Î±-acetoxyacrylate < vinyl chloroacetate < Î±-acetoxystyrene < vinyl acetate < methyl Î±-acetoxyacrylate â‰ˆ vinyl benzoate < methyl Î±-chloroacrylate < vinylidene chloride < methyl methacrylate <2,5-dichlorostyrene <2-chloro-1,3-butadiene < FAVE8< styrene, although additional kinetics are necessary since the experimental conditions, the chosen method to assess the reactivity ratios, and the nature of the radical initiators are different. Hence, it is shown that FAVE8 monomer leads to highly alternating structure and is also more reactive toward ã€°VCNâ€¢ radicals. 5 Thermal Properties of PolyCopolymers DSC analysis was carried out by increasing the temperature of 2 Â°C/min, while carrying out two scans. The DSC thermogram goes up that this alternating fluoronitrile polymer has Tg values of approximately 107 Â°C and a melting pointat about 170 Â°C attributed to the perfluorooctyl groups. This Tm is higher in comparison to that of polyhomopolymer which possess a melting point at 42 Â°C and confirmed the incorporation of VCN units. To conclude, it can be claimed that the polycopolymer exhibits better thermal properties than those of the respective homopolymer. Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis of the polycopolymer shows a high thermal stability. Figure 3 shows the temperature when the copolymer starts to decomposeand the degradation temperature of this copolymercorresponding to 7% weight loss. It is noted that the polyhomopolymer has a low temperature of degradation at about 160 Â°C with depolymerization of degradation mechanism as it was suggested by Grassie and Mc Gucham. This result confirms the absence of the VCNâˆ’VCN diad in the copolymer and thus supplies further evidence of its alternating structure. To complete this study, it was worth investigating the temperature of degradation of polyhomopolymer. A weight loss of 20% from 200 Â°C and a second weight loss at higher temperatureswere found. 6 Surface Properties of PolyCopolymers The films were processed from polycopolymers by press at 170 Â°C. The wettability of the films was studied by contact angle measurements with water (WCA), while oleophobic properties were achieved in a similar manner with diiodomethane as the apolar solvent. As shown in Figure 4, the water contact angle is 168 Â± 3Â°, indicating that superhydrophobic surfaces are obtained, showing that the C8F17 groups migrated to the extreme surface of the film, and probably the CN groups also have a certain input. Indeed, measurements of the angle were sometimes not easy since the sphere of water moved and even escaped from the film as soon as it was deposited (indeed a drop of 2 Î¼L was not easy to deposit, and one had to increase the volume of the drop (ca. 6 Î¼L) until it fell down). This may arise from the C8F17 perfluorinated side group enhanced by the softness brought by the âˆ’OCH2CH2âˆ’ spacer between the backbone and that fluorinated dangling group. Such a highly hydrophobic characteristic was not observed on poly(WCA = 130Â°)probably because the ester group is too stiff. Possible intramolecular complexes between the nitrile groups with adjacent FAVE8 unit may occurwhich also may induce physical cross-linking as we noted on a couple of nonsoluble samples. The effect of side chain length on the surface properties of polythin films were studied by Honda et al. who revealed that a perfluorinated group containing more than 8 carbon atoms was crystalline and formed ordered structure. This result leads to a high water-repellent mechanism. Acatay et al. reported the WCA assessments of a perfluorinated polymer under electric field. These authors also showed that the orientation of apolar fluorinated groups led to a high hydrophobicity (WCA, 167Â°). In our present case, it was not necessary to direct the dipole of VCN because these nitrile groups are located in both sides of the polymeric chain.",,ma9002165,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,complexity of language,,,,table 3 allows us to suggest the following series of relative reactivities of monomers to vcn radicals maleic anhydride  cisdichloroethylene  transdichloroethylene  vinyl choride  acrylic acid 2chloroprene  ethyl acetoxyacrylate  vinyl chloroacetate  acetoxystyrene  vinyl acetate  methyl acetoxyacrylate  vinyl benzoate  methyl chloroacrylate  vinylidene chloride  methyl methacrylate 25dichlorostyrene 2chloro13butadiene  fave8 styrene although additional kinetics are necessary since the experimental conditions the chosen method to assess the reactivity ratios and the nature of the radical initiators are different hence it is shown that fave8 monomer leads to highly alternating structure and is also more reactive toward vcn radicals 5 thermal properties of polycopolymers dsc analysis was carried out by increasing the temperature of 2 cmin while carrying out two scans the dsc thermogram goes up that this alternating fluoronitrile polymer has tg values of approximately 107 c and a melting pointat about 170 c attributed to the perfluorooctyl groups this tm is higher in comparison to that of polyhomopolymer which possess a melting point at 42 c and confirmed the incorporation of vcn units to conclude it can be claimed that the polycopolymer exhibits better thermal properties than those of the respective homopolymer furthermore the thermogravimetric analysis of the polycopolymer shows a high thermal stability figure 3 shows the temperature when the copolymer starts to decomposeand the degradation temperature of this copolymercorresponding to 7 weight loss it is noted that the polyhomopolymer has a low temperature of degradation at about 160 c with depolymerization of degradation mechanism as it was suggested by grassie and mc gucham this result confirms the absence of the vcnvcn diad in the copolymer and thus supplies further evidence of its alternating structure to complete this study it was worth investigating the temperature of degradation of polyhomopolymer a weight loss of 20 from 200 c and a second weight loss at higher temperatureswere found 6 surface properties of polycopolymers the films were processed from polycopolymers by press at 170 c the wettability of the films was studied by contact angle measurements with water wca while oleophobic properties were achieved in a similar manner with diiodomethane as the apolar solvent as shown in figure 4 the water contact angle is 168  3 indicating that superhydrophobic surfaces are obtained showing that the c8f17 groups migrated to the extreme surface of the film and probably the cn groups also have a certain input indeed measurements of the angle were sometimes not easy since the sphere of water moved and even escaped from the film as soon as it was deposited indeed a drop of 2 l was not easy to deposit and one had to increase the volume of the drop ca 6 l until it fell down this may arise from the c8f17 perfluorinated side group enhanced by the softness brought by the och2ch2 spacer between the backbone and that fluorinated dangling group such a highly hydrophobic characteristic was not observed on polywca  130probably because the ester group is too stiff possible intramolecular complexes between the nitrile groups with adjacent fave8 unit may occurwhich also may induce physical crosslinking as we noted on a couple of nonsoluble samples the effect of side chain length on the surface properties of polythin films were studied by honda et al who revealed that a perfluorinated group containing more than 8 carbon atoms was crystalline and formed ordered structure this result leads to a high waterrepellent mechanism acatay et al reported the wca assessments of a perfluorinated polymer under electric field these authors also showed that the orientation of apolar fluorinated groups led to a high hydrophobicity wca 167 in our present case it was not necessary to direct the dipole of vcn because these nitrile groups are located in both sides of the polymeric chain,"[{'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.61364895, 'word': 'maleic anhydr', 'start': 110, 'end': 123}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.6464753, 'word': 'cis -

Thermal gravimetric analysiswas performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris1 at a heating rate of 20 Â°C/min in an atmosphere of nitrogen or air. Dynamic mechanical analysiswas performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond DMA with a sample size of 5. 0 cm Ã— 1. 0 cm Ã— 0. 2 cm. The storage modulus Eâ€² and tan Î´ were determined as the sample was subjected to the temperature scan mode at a programmed heating rate of 5 Â°C/min at a frequency of 1 Hz. The test was performed by a bending mode with an amplitude of 5 Î¼m. Thermal mechanical analysiswas performed with a Perkin-Elmer Pyris Diamond TMA at a heating rate of 5 Â°C/min from 50 to 240 Â°C. Since the samples tend to move a bit due to relaxation of internal stresses in the first run, the coefficient of thermal expansionin the temperature range of 50â€“150 Â°C was recorded from the second-run data. IR spectra were obtained from at least 32 scans in the standard wavenumber range of 400â€“4000 cmâ€“1 using a Perkin-Elmer RX1 infrared spectrophotometer.

16460,16471,11,"The random phase approximationrepresents a theoretical basis to interpret the SANS data in terms of the Floryâ€“Huggins theory. Here we present a SANS study on the binary polymer blend polyand poly(PMMA). The particular interest of this blend stems from the large difference of the glass transition temperatures TG of the two components that are about +121 and âˆ’57 Â°C for the PMMA and PEO polymer melt, respectively. There are several studies of TG in PEO/PMMA mainly determined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fernandes et al. published TG data and a phase diagram of a 300 kDa PEO and 130 kDa PMMA blend showing miscibility at low temperatures with indication of phase decomposition at high temperatures, e. g. , a lower critical solution temperaturephase diagram with a critical temperature at about 230 Â°C and 60% PEO concentration. The phase boundary was determined by cloud point analysis. Polymer blends in the mixed state usually show a single TG which usually agrees with the interpolated single component values via the Foxâ€“Flory equation (p 243 in ref 6). Later differential DSC, however, showed two calorimetric glass transition temperatures in spite of macroscopic miscibility, an upper TG between 121 and 30 Â°C depending on PEO concentration in the regime of 0 < Î¦PEO < 0. 40 and a nearly constant TG at about âˆ’57 Â°C. The two glass transition temperatures are consistent with deuterium NMR experimentsobserving a PEO segmental dynamics which only weakly depends on PEO concentration and is several orders of magnitude faster than the PMMA segments, thereby suggesting a decoupling of the PEO segmental motion from the PMMA matrix even below the upper TG. This implies that the PEO component is still mobile when passing the upper TG and freezes when passing the lower TG at âˆ’57 Â°C. The terminal dynamics of the PEO chains in PMMA was explored with forced Rayleigh scatteringand was found to differ from the PEO segmental dynamics, and appeared to be coupled with the PMMA matrix.

16737,16755,18,"PEO and PMMA Chain ConformationIn a further step the PEO and PMMA chain conformation in the blend was determined. Figure 9a shows the scattering patterns and Guiniersâ€™ law fits of the PEO and PMMA single chain form factor at 25 Â°C. The radius of gyration of the PEO chain of three samples of type d-PEOx/h-PEOy/h-PMMAwith zero scattering contrast for concentration fluctuations and Î¦PEO == 0. 1, 0. 15, and 0. 25are displayed in Figure 9b versus temperature. In those blends the second term of eq 1, representing the PEO form factor, contributes to scattering whereas scattering from density fluctuation is negligible small, e. g. 2% of the scattering of sample S2 which is less than 0. 002 cmâ€“1 within the Q regime of Figure 9a. In Figure 9c, the scattering extrapolated to Q = 0 and T = 0 Â°C is shown for all samples versus total PEO composition. The experimental points follow a straight line intersecting zero at Î¦PEO = 0 according to dÎ£/dÎ©= (8. 08 Â± 0. 05) Ã— Î¦PEO with a slope 2. 5% larger than evaluated from SPEO0= Î¦PEO Ã— VPEO in eq 1 and the parameters in Table 3. At temperatures between 80 and 40 Â°C, the radius of gyration of the PEO chain enhances by about 6%. The temperature of change corresponds to the respective glass transition temperatures as displayed below in the phase diagram (Figure 11). The Rg-values at high T are consistent with the data from ref 46 as indicated by the solid line and are about 10% less than determined in ref 47. The agreement of the PEO and PMMA chain dimensions determined from the blend and the corresponding pure homopolymer melts gives us confidence in the predictions of eq 1 and the sample preparation. Figure 9. Form factor of PEO and PMMA chains in the blend (samples S4â€“6 in Table 3). PMMA chain Rg increases about 2% when heating up the sample from RT to 200 Â°C. Rg of PEO shows a 6% upturn at lower temperatures depending of the PEO content. The temperatures of upturn are depicted below in Figure 11 as triangles and are identified as the glass transition temperature. PEO scattering at Q = 0 is linearly proportional with Î¦PEO and consistent with theory. A similar conformational change at TG was not observed for the PMMA chains; within the temperature interval of RT and 200 Â°Cthe radii of gyration (average âŸ¨RgâŸ© = 32. 1 Â± 0. 45 Ã…) are constant within 2%.

The PVT data were analyzed in terms of two equations of state (EOS). The empirical Tait EOS was applied in the glassy, semicryst. , and equil. melt state, and the Simha-Somcynsky EOS theory was applied in the equil. melt and glassy state. The Simha-Somcynsky EOS theory contains a free vol. function. The temp. , pressure, and compn. dependence of the free vol. fraction h calcd. from the Simha-Somcynsky EOS theory was studied. As a function of blend compn. we observe that the free vol. fraction, thermal expansivity, and compressibility all deviate mainly pos. from linearity while the sp. vol. deviates mainly neg. from linearity. These findings are reconciled with compn. -dependent free vol. parameters, the free vol. and cell vol. as well as with self- and cross-interaction parameters derived from the Simha-Somcynsky EOS theory as applied to polymer mixts. Moreover, the pressure dependence of glass and melting transitions as well as crystn. kinetics have been investigated.

Since the surface fluctuations of the thicker macrocyclic PS films are described well by the HCT of overdamped thermal capillary waves, the viscosity of the macrocyclic melt can be calculated if the surface tension is known. For the linear chains, literature values of surface tensioncan be found, but for greater consistency in our comparison we used surface tensions calculated from a group contribution methodto derive viscosities from the XPCS data, Î·XCPS, for both the linear and cyclic chains. These values of Î·XCPS for the linear chains agree well with values of viscosity measured in the bulk using conventional rheometry, as shown in Figure 7a, confirming the observation of Kim et al. with linear chains of other molecular weights. This agreement for these unentangled linear chains is consistent with the contention that the surface fluctuation dynamics probed in the time and qâˆ¥ window available here are dictated by the chain dynamics that also manifest themselves in the phenomenon of bulk viscosity.

xcps for the linear chains agree well with values of viscosity measured in the bulk using conventional rheometry as shown in figure 7a confirming the observation of kim et al with linear chains of other molecular weights this agreement for these unentangled linear chains is consistent with the contention that the surface fluctuation dynamics probed in the time and q window available here are

Temperature dependence of bulk viscosity according to data from the literaturefor a molecular weight range of cyclic and linear PS and temperature range similar to those probed in the XPCS measurements. Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionReferencesConclusionThe surface fluctuations of unentangled cyclic polystyrenes of Mn = 2K, 7K, and 14K are slower than those of linear analogues, with the disparity decreasing with increasing molecular weight. This difference caused by chain architecture can be rationalized on the basis of the behavior of melt bulk viscosity for sufficiently thick films. The variations in viscosities of the linear and cyclic polystyrenes derived from XPCSover the small range of M probed are consistent with the existence of a crossover from a region at low M in which Î·cyclic > Î·linear, to a region in which Î·cyclic < Î·linear. The data available here suggest a crossover molecular weight of about 22K at 120 Â°C, 24K at 130 Â°C, and 31K at 140 Â°C. For M â‰ª Mc, the local density of polymer segments controls both bulk and surface fluctuation dynamics, resulting in a stronger molecular weight dependence of surface fluctuations on M for films of linear polystyrene than for CPS and slower relaxation of surface fluctuations on the cyclic melt film than on the analogue linear melt film. Universal scaling of the surface dynamics with film thickness is seen for all but the thinnest film studied for hyCPS14K, and viscosities inferred from the XPCS data using the HCT for all the other films agree well with bulk viscosity measurements. Coincidence between Î·XPCS and Î·bulk for both cyclic chains and the linear analogues, and the universal behavior of the relaxation time with T/Tg,bulk, implies that the surface relaxations are controlled by chain dynamics in the regime studied.",,ma2028215,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,0,figure 10 temperature dependence of bulk viscosity according to data from the literaturefor a molecular weight range of cyclic and linear ps and temperature range similar to those probed in the xpcs measurements top of pageabstractintroductionexperimental sectionresults and discussionconclusionreferencesconclusionthe surface fluctuations of unentangled cyclic polystyrenes of mn  2k 7k and 14k are slower than those of linear analogues with the disparity decreasing with increasing molecular weight this difference caused by chain architecture can be rationalized on the basis of the behavior of melt bulk viscosity for sufficiently thick films the variations in viscosities of the linear and cyclic polystyrenes derived from xpcsover the small range of m probed are consistent with the existence of a crossover from a region at low m in which cyclic  linear to a region in which cyclic  linear the data available here suggest a crossover molecular weight of about 22k at 120 c 24k at 130 c and 31k at 140 c for m  mc the local density of polymer segments controls both bulk and surface fluctuation dynamics resulting in a stronger molecular weight dependence of surface fluctuations on m for films of linear polystyrene than for cps and slower relaxation of surface fluctuations on the cyclic melt film than on the analogue linear melt film universal scaling of the surface dynamics with film thickness is seen for all but the thinnest film studied for hycps14k and viscosities inferred from the xpcs data using the hct for all the other films agree well with bulk viscosity measurements coincidence between xpcs and bulk for both cyclic chains and the linear analogues and the universal behavior of the relaxation time with ttgbulk implies that the surface relaxations are controlled by chain dynamics in the regime studied,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.3792569, 'word': 'cyclic', 'start': 121, 'end': 127}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.61043066, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 139, 'end': 141}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.45956737, 'word': 'polystyrene', 'start': 364, 'end': 375}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.6505725, 'word': 'mn', 'start': 380, 'end': 382}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.5730477, 'word': '2k', 'start': 385, 'end': 387}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.46109, 'word': '7k', 'start': 389, 'end': 391}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.49592096, 'word': 'polystyrene', 'start': 710, 'end': 721}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.7444266, 'word': 'molecular weight', 'start': 961, 'end': 977}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.8269024, 'word': '22k', 'start': 987, 'end': 990}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.80738056, 'word': '24k', 'start': 1003, 'end': 1006}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.814411, 'word': '31k', 'start': 1023, 'end': 1026}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.5861738, 'word': 'polystyrene', 'start': 1245, 'end': 1256}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.61096483, 'word': 'cps', 'start': 1266, 'end': 1269}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.586455, 'word': 'hycps14k', 'start': 1491, 'end': 1499}]","2k, 7k, 22k, 24k, 31k"

(Elsevier Ltd. ) Monodisperse low-mol. -wt. cyclic poly(oxyethylene)s (CPOE)s were synthesized from linear dihydroxy-terminated poly(oxyethylene)s (LPOE)s. The self-diffusion, NMR spin-spin relaxation, and zero-shear viscosity of CPOE and LPOE, as well as linear dimethoxy-terminated poly(LPOEDE), were measured in the melt state. The self-diffusion coeffs. measured at 56 Â°C were ordered in the following sequence: LPOEDE > CPOE > LPOE, which is in excellent agreement with NMR spin-spin relaxation and viscosity data. The slower motion of LPOE compared to LPOEDE was attributed to chain-end hydrogen bonding. Scaling relations with mol. wt. and activation energies were reconciled with chain-end and topol. effects.

18099,18131,32,"Two model samples are investigated: a melt crystallized sample prepared by injection molding and a sample obtained by crystallization from dilute solution. Our investigations reveal that, for both samples, there is an increase in crystalline motions and in the amorphous content on heating. DMA and AFM measurements reveal that the modulus of the molded sample decreases on heating to about 100 Â°C; however, there is a significant difference in behavior of the solution crystals, where we observe no significant decrease in stiffness (from AFM measurements). Thus, in contrast to previous reports, we demonstrate that the decrease in modulus on heating polyoxymethylene does not correlate with chain motions in the crystalline regions. We use SAXS to probe the semicrystalline morphology for the samples on heating and show that, for the molded sample, there is a distribution of lamellar thickness at room temperature and that the thin lamellae in this distribution melt on heating. In contrast to the behavior of the melt crystallized samples, the solution crystals exhibit no change in the lamellar stacking on heating to 150 Â°C. We also demonstrate that, on heating, the amorphous regions in the solution crystals always appear to have restricted mobility while there are mobile and low mobility amorphous regions in the molded samples. Our results suggest that, contrary to conventional belief, the decrease in modulus on heating polyoxymethylene arises not from motions in the crystalline lamellae but primarily from melting of thin lamellae. Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesIntroductionPolyoxymethyleneis an engineering thermoplastic that is used to make injection-molded parts for applications that require stiffness and fatigue endurance. POM has a nominal melting point, TM, around 175 Â°C. However, the â€œdeflection temperatureâ€ for POM is 97 Â°C (at a loading of 1. 8 MPa, ISO standards(1a)), considerably lower than TM. The low deflection temperature for POM precludes its use in applications with a continuous use temperature greater than around 100 Â°C. The decrease in POM modulus near the deflection temperature has been attributed to crystalline motions, which increase with temperature, even far below the melting point. Here, we present data which suggests that it is, in fact, the melting of thin crystalline lamellae that is primarily responsible for the low deflection temperature of POM and not crystal motions. We begin by briefly summarizing the literature on the semicrystalline microstructure and mechanical relaxations of polyoxymethylene that form the starting point for our investigations. Homopolymer polyoxymethylene has a high degree of crystallinity (typical crystallinity â‰ˆ65%), with an extrapolated equilibrium melting temperature of 184 Â°C and heat of fusion of 326 J/g. From a fit to the measured heat capacity data, it has been reported that the microstructure of polyoxymethylene comprises of crystalline, amorphous, and â€œrigid amorphousâ€ domains,the relative fractions of which are strongly influenced by sample preparation conditions. This accords with solid-state NMR 1H T2 and 1H spin diffusion studies carried out on commercial POM samplesthat indicate the presence of crystalline as well as two amorphous phases differentiated by their molecular mobility. In these studies, the less mobile component was attributed to chains located in the regions at amorphousâ€“crystalline interface and to tie molecules stretched between crystalline lamellae. The structure of the crystalâ€“amorphous interface in semicrystalline polymers has been investigated by other groups as well (see, for example, a recent review(8)), and such studies suggest that polymer chains in interfacial regions play an important role in determining material properties. Polyoxymethylene shows a sharp, relatively narrow melting peak in DSCâ€”however, modulated DSCmeasurements suggest that the structural change on heating is more complex. On the basis of mDSC data, Sauer et al. suggest that there is melting and recrystallization of POM crystals over the temperature range from 60 to 160 Â°C. Tashiro and co-workers have used a combination of experimental techniquesto provide a detailed picture of microstructure formation and melting during heating, cooling, or annealing melts of polyoxymethylene. They claim that, in polyoxymethylene, morphological development happens in three stages on cooling from the melt. At first, on cooling the melt to 160 Â°C, dominant lamellar stacks comprised of chain-folded crystals form with a spacing of â‰ˆ18 nm. On further cooling to about 140 Â°C, there is insertion of thin, â‰ˆ7 nm crystals of extended chain crystals in between stacks of dominant lamellae. Interestingly, their FTIR data revealthat the thin extended chain crystals formed on cooling melt at relatively low temperatures, significantly lower than the nominal melting point of polyoxymethylene. Finally, on further cooling, the stacks â€œmatureâ€ and crystallization is complete with some internal rearrangements. For crystallization at higher temperatures, around 150 Â°C, only dominant lamellae form, and there is no development of thin, imperfect lamellae between the dominant stacks. This microstructural model of thick dominant lamellae intercalated with thin imperfect lamellae accords well with previous work. Polyoxymethylene shows four relaxation transitions:Î´-transition around âˆ’223 Â°C, which has not yet been unambiguously assigned;Î³-transition extending from âˆ’120 to âˆ’70 Â°C comprising a doublet(low-temperature peak due to crystal dislocations and high-temperature relaxation corresponding to short-range cooperative amorphous relaxations); Î²-transition near 0 Â°C which has been identified as the glass transition;and a strong Î±-transition observed over a broad range of temperatures from 50 to 150 Â°C. The reported activation energies for the Î±-transition vary widely, between 92and 22 kcal/mol. Recent creep rate spectroscopy investigations suggest that the Î±-transition may be attributed to motions of amorphous chain segments constrained to various degrees by the extent of their association with crystalline lamellaeand that there is increased motion as temperature is increased and as crystalline constraints â€œsoftenâ€ due to melting of thin lamellae.",,ma3004423,1,1,1,1,1,0.5,context?,,,,two model samples are investigated a melt crystallized sample prepared by injection molding and a sample obtained by crystallization from dilute

18135,18151,16,"Work from the groups of Wardand Hatausing simultaneous WAXD and stressâ€“strain measurements suggests that, with increasing temperature, there is a decrease in the crystalline modulus of POM. Hata and co-workersclaim that the decrease in crystal modulus near 100 Â°C is due to increased mobility of the polyoxymethylene chain molecules in crystalline regions (that they term â€œincoherent thermal vibrations of the crystal latticeâ€). Thus, some researchers have suggested a causal relationbetween helical jumps observed in the crystalline regions of POMby NMR and the decrease in mechanical modulus on heating. Here, we probe the change in semicrystalline microstructure due to lamellar melting and reorganization on heating POM to investigate if these play a role in the observed decrease in mechanical modulus. We investigate temperature-dependent microstructural changes in POM using multiple structural probes, including modulated DSC to examine melting at a macroscopic level, SAXS to examine changes in the lamellar-level organization, and solid-state NMRto examine the evolution of crystal and amorphous regions on temperature change. While all the aforementioned techniques probe microstructural change during heating, they are sensitive to changes at different length scales. Thus, the estimates of crystallinity from NMR, for example, is not expected to be quantitatively identical to that from DSC. However, taken together, the information from these multiple probes provides a complete picture of the temperature-dependent changes in POM on heating. To separate out the influence of lamellar size distributions from helical in the crystalline regions in POM, we examine two samples with very different distributions of lamellar sizes: one that is melt crystallized by injection molding at a mold temperature of 90 Â°C and another that is obtained by isothermal crystallization from dilute solution. To probe temperature-dependent mechanical properties, we use dynamical mechanical analysisand AFM force distance measurements for the molded polyoxymethylene and compare with AFM measurements on solution crystals. Our results indicate that, contrary to previous reports, it is the change in lamellar structurethat plays a dominant role in determining the temperature-dependent mechanical modulus of the POM. Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesExperimental SectionExperiments were conducted on commercial samples of homopolymer polyoxymethylene, Delrin from DuPont (Mn = 55 900 g molâ€“1 and Mw = 112 700 g molâ€“1). The manufacturer specifications state that the polymer contains only the standard additive package for thermal stabilization. Melt-crystallized samples were prepared by compounding the polymer pellets in a corotating twin-screw microcompounderat a temperature of 200 Â°C at 100 rpm for 5 min and by subsequently injection moldingthem in a mold (dimensions: 0. 125 in.

Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesResults and DiscussionWe begin by comparing modulated DSC thermograms of the melt crystallized samples with the solution crystals (Figure 1). The melt crystallized sample shows a peak melting temperature of 173. 8 Â°C, similar to that of the solution crystals (174. 1 Â°C). It is more illustrative to examine the differences between melt and solution crystallized samples in the reversing and nonreversing heat flows of the modulated DSC (Figure 1, inset). While the total heat flow indicates that melting for both melt and solution crystallized samples happens sharply, over a relatively small range of temperatures, the reversing heat flow shows an endothermic signal starting at much lower temperaturesfor the melt crystallized samplesas compared to the solution crystals (â‰ˆ145 Â°C). Close to the sharp melting endotherm near 174 Â°C, we observe peaks in the reversing signals from both melt crystallized samples and solution crystalsâ€”these are, however, experimental artifactsdue to the rapidity of the melting transition relative to the rate of temperature modulation. Therefore, we restrict our comparisons of the reversing and nonreversing signals to temperatures lower than the onset of the melting peak (â‰ˆ171 Â°C). Corresponding to the endotherm in the reversing heat flow, the nonreversing heat flow exhibits a broad exotherm starting at low temperatures (Figure 1, inset). The features observed in our thermograms are qualitatively similar to those reported earlier for melt crystallized polyoxymethylene. As in the literature,we interpret the reversing signal as arising from premelting of crystals at lower temperatures than the melting point (â‰ˆ174 Â°C). Thus, the melt crystallized samples exhibit significant melting and recrystallization over a broad temperature range, starting at temperatures as low as 70 Â°C, while the solution crystals exhibit a smaller extent of melting and recrystallization at elevated temperatures, above 145 Â°C. We now describe SAXS and solid-state NMR experiments that describe the temperature-dependent semicrystalline microstructure of the melt crystallized sample and solution crystals. Figure 1.

Evidence for Change in Lamellar Microstructure with Temperature Change (SAXS)We present Lorentz corrected intensities as a function of temperature as a molded specimen is heated from room temperatureto 150 Â°C and then cooled back to 25 Â°C (Figure 2a), and since our interest is in understanding the origin of the decrease in modulus near 100 Â°C, for anothermolded specimen that is heated from 25 to 110 Â°C and then cooled back to 25 Â°C (Figure 2b).

18285,18294,9,"Further, our conclusions are in accord with previous literature. For example, we observe that the change in the morphology of our molded sample appears to be â€œreversibleâ€ on cooling back to 25 Â°C from 110 Â°C; however, on heating to 150 Â°C, there is an â€œirreversibleâ€ change in the morphology as the long spacing is higher, as are the crystalline and amorphous thicknesses on cooling back to 25 Â°C. These results can also be interpreted in the context of the work of Bershtein et al. ,who conclude, from creep rate spectroscopy data, that polyoxymethylene shows highly constrained segmental relaxations until 107 Â°C and that on increasing the temperature to 147 Â°C, there is a gradual decrease and disappearance of constraints and an onset of cooperative motions. Thus, the constraints imposed by the thick lamellae when heated to 110 Â°C are such that the thin lamellae re-form to give almost the original semicrystalline morphology on cooling back to 25 Â°C. However, on heating to 150 Â°C, the motional constraints imposed by the thick lamellae disappear, and the morphology â€œannealsâ€ to a higher value of the long spacing and crystalline thickness that persist on cooling back to 25 Â°C. Finally, these results also accord with the electron microscopic studies of Petermann and co-workers,who showed that, in the case of melt crystallized polyethylene with a distribution of lamellar thicknesses, thin crystallites melted first on heating. They observed that, on annealing at temperatures just above the melting temperature for the thin crystallites, the thicker lamellae reorganized and thickened at the expense of the thinner lamellae. We now examine the temperature dependence of the small-angle X-ray scattering from solution crystals. Unlike the molded samples, there is little qualitative or quantitative change in the SAXS on heating the solution crystals from 25 to 150 Â°C (Figure 7). SAXS from the solution crystals exhibit three weak peaksâ€”these peaks are observed as shoulders at low temperatures and are somewhat more clearly defined at higher temperatures (Figure 7).",,ma3004423,1,1,1,0,1,,,,,0,further our conclusions are in accord with previous literature for example we observe that the change in the morphology of our molded sample appears to be reversible on cooling back to 25 c from 110 c however on heating to 150 c there is an irreversible change in the morphology as the long spacing is higher as are the crystalline and amorphous thicknesses on cooling back to 25 c these results can also be interpreted in the context of the work of bershtein et al who conclude from creep rate spectroscopy data that polyoxymethylene shows highly constrained segmental relaxations until 107 c and that on increasing the temperature to 147 c there is a gradual decrease and disappearance of constraints and an onset of cooperative motions thus the constraints imposed by the thick lamellae when heated to 110 c are such that the thin lamellae reform to give almost the original semicrystalline morphology on cooling back to 25 c however on heating to 150 c the motional constraints imposed by the thick lamellae disappear and the morphology anneals to a higher value of the long spacing and crystalline thickness that persist on cooling back to 25 c finally these results also accord with the electron microscopic studies of petermann and coworkerswho showed that in the case of melt crystallized polyethylene with a distribution of lamellar thicknesses thin crystallites melted first on heating they observed that on annealing at temperatures just above the melting temperature for the thin crystallites the thicker lamellae reorganized and thickened at the expense of the thinner lamellae we now examine the temperature dependence of the smallangle xray scattering from solution crystals unlike the molded samples there is little qualitative or quantitative change in the saxs on heating the solution crystals from 25 to 150 c figure 7 saxs from the solution crystals exhibit three weak peaksthese peaks are observed as shoulders at low temperatures and are somewhat more clearly defined at higher temperatures figure 7,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.8996641, 'word': 'polyoxymethylene', 'start': 550, 'end': 566}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.60518104, 'word': 'polyethylene', 'start': 1360, 'end': 1372}]",

18379,18385,6,"On heating, there is melting of thin lamellae, and therefore, chains in the mobile amorphous regionsin the molded sample exhibit rapid thermal motions, resulting in the significant line width narrowing observed in our experiments. Our results accord well with recent work on the temperature-dependent changes in the mobility of polyethylene chains in the crystalline, amorphous and interphase regions for solution and melt crystallized samples of UHMWPE. These studies indicate that there is increased motion in the amorphous regions on heating and that the nature of motions in the amorphous regions is different in solution and melt crystallized samples.

18426,18445,19,"Thus, the picture that emerges from our temperature-dependent microstructural and mechanical measurements is the following:On heating polyoxymethylene, there is an increase in the motions in the crystalline domains for both solution and melt crystallized samples. There is also an increase in the amorphous contentâ€”however, the nature of the amorphous content and therefore the motions in the amorphous content are different in the case of solution crystals when compared with the molded samples. Both solution crystals and molded samples show a motionally constrained rigid amorphous phase, and in addition, we observe a highly mobile amorphous phase in the molded samples. The molded samples have a broad distribution of lamellar thicknesses that can be described by a lamellar stack insertion model. On heating, thin lamellae premelt at temperatures starting at about 50 Â°C. The change in microstructure due to melting is reversible on cooling for molded samples that are heated to 110 Â°C. Samples that are heated above 135 Â°C anneal to form thicker lamellae, and the semicrystalline microstructure is qualitatively changed. In comparison, solution crystals comprise stacks of lamellae with uniform thickness. There is no change in the SAXS from the solution crystals on heating up to 150 Â°C and on subsequent cooling to room temperature, indicating that the stacked lamellar microstructure does not change on heating. AFM measurements suggest that there is no change in the stiffness of the solution crystals with temperature. However, for the molded samples there is a decrease in the AFM stiffness that corresponds with trends in the DMA modulus with increase in temperature. Thus, we believe that the change in modulus near 100 Â°C for the molded samplesdoes not result from an increase in crystal motions/decrease in crystal modulusâ€”rather, it results from a morphological change due to the melting of the thin imperfect lamellae on heating. The decrease in solid modulus on heating the molded samples comes primarily from premelting of thin lamellae rather than from the increase in crystal motions. Therefore, while chain motions in the crystalline regions might relate to the modulus of a semicrystalline polymer, the decrease in modulus leading to the deflection temperature of POM appears to be related to the distribution of lamellar thickness rather than crystal motions. Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesConclusionsThere are qualitative differences in the temperature-dependent microstructural evolution of melt crystallized molded samples and solution crystals of polyoxymethylene. These changes reveal why the solid modulus of molded samples of POM decreases on heating to about 100 Â°C, well below the melting point of about 175 Â°C. A combination of modulated DSC, temperature-dependent SAXS, and temperature-dependent solid state NMR revealed thatmelt crystallized POM had a lamellar stack structure with thin, imperfect lamellae inserted between thicker lamellae;on heating melt crystallized POM, the thin, imperfect lamellae melted at relatively low temperatures, well below the nominal melting point; andthat the fraction of amorphous content increased on heating, and there was an increase in the thermal motions in the amorphous regions resulting in narrower NMR line widths. In contrast, for the solution crystals,the structure comprises of stacks of lamellar crystals assembled out of dilute solution,there is no change in the stacking of these crystals on heating to 150 Â°C, andwhile there is an increase in amorphous content on heating, this is from melting at the basal surfaces of the lamellae and does not result in narrowing of the NMR line widths. Temperature-dependent DMAas well as AFM forceâ€“distance curvesindicate that while there is a decrease in the stiffness of the molded samples on heating to 100 Â°C, there is no significant change in the AFM forceâ€“distance â€œsensitivityâ€ of the solution crystals. Combining the temperature-dependent data on semicrystalline microstructure and mechanical properties, it appears that it is the change in semicrystalline microstructure due to premelting of thin lamellae rather than enhanced motions in the crystalline regions that contributes to the decrease in the modulus of polyoxymethylene on heating to 100 Â°C.",,ma3004423,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,,,,,thus the picture that emerges from our temperaturedependent microstructural and mechanical measurements is the followingon heating polyoxymethylene there is an increase in the motions in the crystalline domains for both solution and melt crystallized samples there is also an increase in the amorphous contenthowever the nature of the amorphous content and therefore the motions in the amorphous content are different in the case of solution crystals when compared with the molded samples both solution crystals and molded samples show a motionally constrained rigid amorphous phase and in addition we observe a highly mobile amorphous phase in the molded samples the molded samples have a broad distribution of lamellar thicknesses that can be described by a lamellar stack insertion model on heating thin lamellae premelt at temperatures starting at about 50 c the change in microstructure due to melting is reversible on cooling for molded samples that are heated to 110 c samples that are heated above 135 c anneal to form thicker lamellae and the semicrystalline microstructure is qualitatively changed in comparison solution crystals comprise stacks of lamellae with uniform thickness there is no change in the saxs from the solution crystals on heating up to 150 c and on subsequent cooling to room temperature indicating that the stacked lamellar microstructure does not change on heating afm measurements suggest that there is no change in the stiffness of the solution crystals with temperature however for the molded samples there is a decrease in the afm stiffness that corresponds with trends in the dma modulus with increase in temperature thus we believe that the change in modulus near 100 c for the molded samplesdoes not result from an increase in crystal motionsdecrease in crystal modulusrather it results from a morphological change due to the melting of the thin imperfect lamellae on heating the decrease in solid modulus on heating the molded samples comes primarily from premelting of thin lamellae rather than from the increase in crystal motions therefore while chain motions in the crystalline regions might relate to the modulus of a semicrystalline polymer the decrease in modulus leading to the deflection temperature of pom appears to be related to the distribution of lamellar thickness rather than crystal motions top of pageabstractintroductionexperimental sectionresults and discussionconclusionsreferencesconclusionsthere are qualitative differences in the temperaturedependent microstructural evolution of melt crystallized molded samples and solution crystals of polyoxymethylene these changes reveal why the solid modulus of molded samples of pom decreases on heating to about 100 c well below the melting point of about 175 c a combination of modulated dsc temperaturedependent saxs and temperaturedependent solid state nmr revealed thatmelt crystallized pom had a lamellar stack structure with thin imperfect lamellae inserted between thicker lamellaeon heating melt crystallized pom the thin imperfect lamellae melted at relatively low temperatures well below the nominal melting point andthat the fraction of amorphous content increased on heating and there was an increase in the thermal motions in the amorphous regions resulting in narrower nmr line widths in contrast for the solution crystalsthe structure comprises of stacks of lamellar crystals assembled out of dilute solutionthere is no change in the stacking of these crystals on heating to 150 c andwhile there is an increase in amorphous content on heating this is from melting at the basal surfaces of the lamellae and does not result in narrowing of the nmr line widths temperaturedependent dmaas well as afm forcedistance curvesindicate that while there is a decrease in the stiffness of the molded samples on heating to 100 c there is no significant change in the afm forcedistance sensitivity of the solution crystals combining the temperaturedependent data on semicrystalline microstructure and mechanical properties it appears that it is the change in semicrystalline microstructure due to premelting of thin lamellae rather than enhanced motions in the crystalline regions that contributes to the decrease in the modulus of polyoxymethylene on heating to 100 c,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9397281, 'word': 'polyoxymethylene', 'start': 134, 'end': 150}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.93340325, 'word': 'polyoxymethylene', 'start': 2650, 'end': 2666}]",

(Marcel Dekker, Inc. ) Temp. scanning techniques, including synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD), and temp. -modulated DSC, were used to study melting and recrystn. in semicryst. polyoxymethylene (POM). The isothermal crystn. of POM also was studied by time-resolved SAXS. From SAXS profiles, several morphol. variables were calcd. , including the long period (L), lamellar thickness (lc), interlamellar amorphous thicknessand scattering invariant (Q). The lamellar parameters also were obtained using tapping AFM for two thermal histories, and some lamellar-scale and larger-scale morphol. changes were characterized before and after partial melting. These real-space images also provided support to interpretation of SAXS anal. in the interpretation of 1st- and 2nd-order intensity maxima. During melting at const. heating rates, la from SAXS increased slowly starting at âˆ¼100Â°, suggesting melting of thin inserted lamellae, and at âˆ¼150Â°, lc began to increase combined with a more rapid increase in la due to further melting of inserted lamellae and some recrystn. into sep. stacks of lamellae. The end of melting was about 182Â°C. Temp. -modulated DSC data also characterized the level of melting and recrystn. starting at low temps. for a quenched sample. The DSC data provide the total extent of melting, and this was contrasted with the drop in SAXS and WAXD intensities. SAXS and temp. -modulated DSC temp. scans on a quenched, but still highly cryst. , POM sample were compared with the data from a high-temp. isothermally crystd. POM sample with a higher degree of crystal perfection.

The activity of the Ï€-allylPdCl/NaBPh4 system at the low temperatures is remarkable in comparison with the (NHC)Pd/borate systems, which drastically diminish their activity even at 0 Â°C to give poly1â€² only in a trace yield. Throughout the polymerization temperature variation (runs 2â€“4), the appearance of main chain CH signals in their 1H NMR spectra, which has been shown to be dependent on the main chain tacticitywas almost identical as those observed in the spectra of poly1â€™s obtained with the IMesPd/borate systems, indicating that the Ï€-allylPdCl-based systems gave atactic polymers. In runs 1 and 5, the polymerization of EDA at âˆ’20 Â°C was conducted with [EDA]/[Pd] feed ratios of 50 and 200, respectively. With the increase of the feed ratio (runs 1, 2, and 5), while Mn of poly1â€² increased gradually, the IE drastically increased up to 156% at [EDA]/[Pd] = 200. These results suggest that occurrence of chain transfer becomes more significant with the higher [EDA]/[Pd] ratios, rendering the synthesis of high molecular weight poly1â€² difficult. It is possible that the observed high IEs do not demonstrate quantitative generation of active species from the Ï€-allylPdCl complex, but the generation of the active species in lower efficiency followed by frequent occurrence of chain transfer, particularly in the case of higher [EDA]/[Pd] feed ratios.

Reviewers for this paper asked an interesting question for an effectof the strain rate on the elongational behavior of the multiblock copolymer systems, partly in relation to the behavior of entangled homopolymers. The elongational behavior of homopolymers is strongly affected by the Rouse time Ï„R of the chain, and the strain-hardening is observed for branched polymer meltsas well as solutions of linear polymersat the strain rate larger than 1/Ï„R. In contrast, for the multiblock copolymer systems, the time Ï„* required for deformation-induced pullout of the S blocks and the deformation-assisted transfer of the S blocks, not the Rouse time of the copolymer chain as a whole, appears to be the essential factor governing the elongational behavior. In fact, a preliminary experiment suggested that the undecablock system became less extensible at lower T (= 7 Â°C), which is in harmony with this argument for Ï„*.

A catalyst consisting of dibutyltin oxide, germanium oxide, and Ac2O exhibited excellent performance characteristics in syntheses of a high-molecular-weight homopolyester of ISB and cis/trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid (CHDA), also referred to as poly(PICD). The acetylation of ISB using Ac2O during esterification decreased the steric hindrance of ISB and accelerated the chain growth of PICD. Gel permeation chromatography data confirmed the formation of a high-molecular-weight PICDusing 0. 02 mol of Ac2O. The glass transition temperature of PICD was almost 131 Â°C at 0. 02 mol of Ac2O and decreased with increasing amounts of Ac2O due to the breaking of the rigid ring of ISB at higher concentrations of Ac2O.

21646,21658,12,"In case of in situ acetylation polymerization, acidity in the system is relatively high enough to form 1,4 sorbitanby breakage of ISB. This results in the formation of branch structure in the polymer chain and giving broad MWD to PICD polymer. Figure 1Sshows the variation of the Î·â€² of PICD-1â€“PICD-75 at 270 Â°C from 0. 05 rad/s to 600 rad/s. In Figure 1S (Supporting Information), PICD-2â€“PICD-75 which have broad MWD, shows that the onset shear rate of shear thinning is shorter compared with PICD-1. The shear viscosity at the extremely low shear rate is dependent on the Mw of each sample. Also, the hydrodynamic volume of branched polymer at low shear region in the melt state is relatively higher than that of nonbranched polymer, which means that the branched polymer has higher free volume. This larger free volume enables polymer chain to be compressed at a high shear rate, leading to increase the degree of shear thinning, which is pseudoplasticity. As shown in Figure 1S (Supporting Information), the degree of shear thinning of PICD-1 is lower than that of PICD-2â€“PICD-75. Degrees of polymerizationof PICD-1 and PICD-75 are the same in Table 1. However, the amount of branch structure by open-ring ISB of PICD-75 is larger than PICD-1 due to higher AcOH contents in polymerization. The noticeable difference of shear-thinning between PICD-1 and PICD-75 is shown in this melt curve. This may reflect the branch structure leading to high MWD of PICD-2 to PICD-75. Figure 6.

The content if isosorbide was considerably lower than expected from the feed ratio and the molar masses were low, so that no DSC measurements were conducted. Copolycondensations of isosorbide and 1,4-butane diol with terephthaloyl chloride were either performed in dichloromethane at 40Â°C or in toluene at 100 Â°C. The second method gave the higher molar masses. However, both series of polycondensations had the content of isosorbide roughly paralleled the feed ratios in common. The DSC measurements revealed that even 6 mol% of isosorbide roughly paralleled the feed ratios in common. The DSC measurements revealed that even 6 mol% of isosorbide is sufficient to raise the glass-transition temp. by 10-12 Â°C (up to 55 Â°C). With 50 mol% of isosorbide, the Tg reaches 100 Â°C. Yet, incorporation of isosorbide also reduces the melting temp. and the degree of crystallinity, and a mol. percentage above 30% prevents crystn. completely. In summary, incorporation of isosorbide allows for fine-tuning of Tg and Tm of polyover a wide range.

The crystn. kinetics was evaluated by the Avrami equation: it proceeds by heterogeneous nucleation with one-dimensional linear growth (n = 1. 1-1. 8). The effects of the length of the alkyl side chain and of the undercooling were investigated. Phase I, Phase II, and a nematic mesophase were detected in P3BT and P3DDT. In P3BT, Phase I was differentiable from the mesophase on the basis of wide-angle X-ray scatteringpatterns. This study gives insight, in particular, on the crystn. and melting behavior of P3BT, a polymer not yet well studied.

The CO2 adsorption capacity of these polymers was evaluated using a thermogravimetric analyzer (atm. pressure tests) and a high pressure magnetic suspension balance (high pressure tests). CO2 capture capacity was related to HCP textural properties. HCP performance for CO2 adsorption at atm. pressure was characterized by max. CO2 uptake of 1. 7 mmol/g (7. 4 wt. %) at 298Â° K. At higher pressure (30 bar), HCP have CO2 uptake of â‰¤13. 4 mmol/g (59 wt. %), superior to zeolite-based materialsand com. activated C (BPL, Norit R). Also, these polymers exhibited low isosteric heats of CO2 adsorption and good CO2 selectivity.

Vega et al. compared the shear-induced crystallization behaviors of linear iPP and LCB iPP by using rheometry, in which lower values of the induction time for the onset of crystallization process were found at the low and moderate preshear conditions, and the effect was much more pronounced for LCB iPP than for linear iPP. Recently, Kitade et al. studied the shear-induced crystallization of LCB iPP at 170 Â°C, close to the melting temperature, and at a low shear rate of 2 sâ€“1 by SAXS, WAXS, and POM, which demonstrated that shish-like structures predominately formed and the further growth to kebabs was suppressed in LCB iPP. However, it is clearly concerned that overall there is a lack of systematic investigation on the relationship between the chosen shear conditions and crystallization kinetics and morphological evolution for the LCB polymer materials, which is definitely vital to understanding the crystallization behaviors of LCB polymer materials for processing, compared with extensive studies on the shear-induced crystallization of their linear counterparts. Polylactide (PLA), as an environment friendly semicrystalline polymer produced from renewable resource, has received great attention in recent years. The processing behavior can be remarkably optimized by the introduction of long chain branchingstructures in linear PLA matrix to improve the melt rheological properties such as melt strength and strain hardening. Although the crystallization behavior of linear PLA has been extensively investigated in quiescent conditions as well as under shear flow,the studies on crystallization behavior of PLA materials with LCB structures were only performed in quiescent conditions, aiming to investigate the influences of LCB structures. The results showed that the different crystallization behaviors of LCB PLA compared with that of linear ones were tightly associated with the degree of branching, the type of chain extender, and its functional groups. The effects of long chain branching on the shear-induced crystallization of PLA materials have not been reported so far. Recently, a new class of LCB PLA polymers was prepared from linear PLA precursor by applying Î³ radiation with addition of the trifunctional monomer, trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA).

23336,23350,14,"Figure 13 presents a schematic illustration of the mechanism for understanding the effects of LCB structures on the crystallization behavior of PLA materials when the PLA melts are sheared for long duration (more than the saturation shear time). The PLA material is first completely melted and quickly cooled to the crystallization temperature, for which the undercooled melt is disordered and the polymer chains in the undercooled melts are amorphous with Gaussian conformation. With the short shear time, both linear PLA and LCB PLA demonstrate the enhanced nucleation density of point-like nuclei and the nucleation density for LCB PLA is higher than that of linear PLA, because more segments of chains are aligned in LCB PLA to participate in the shear-induced nucleation process. With the long shear time, LCB PLA shows a different scenario from that of linear PLA. When linear PLA melts are sheared at the shear rate of 1 sâ€“1 (Ï„RÎ³Ì‡ = 1. 17), the stretch of the linear chain is weak and the stretched chain is easy to relax after the cession of shear flow, only resulting in the shear-induced point-like nucleation density enhancement. On the other hand, when LCB PLA is sheared at the shear rate of 1 sâ€“1, the Weissenberg numberfor LCB is far greater than 1, suggesting that the LCB chains can be strongly stretched in the shear flow field. Thus, when the melt is sheared for more than a critical shear time, large bond orientation of LCB PLA chains is achieved, and the stretched chain conformation can be reserved to form the fibrillar coreafter the cessation of shear, due to the fact that LCB molecules possess the long relaxation time (see Figure 13). In the subsequent isothermal crystallization process, the free coiled PLA chains can be absorbed on the surface of the shish to form the chain-folding lamellae (kebabs). Figure 13.

25184,25210,26,"For c-4sPCL(2K)â€“PEG (1:1), with the increasing of the irradiation time, the temperature of crystallizationreduced from 20. 48 to 18. 47 Â°C, and the crystallized peak shifted from two peaks to a single one (Figure 2A). The crystallization behavior of c-4sPCL(2K)â€“PEGis similar to c-4sPCL(2K)â€“PEG(Figure 2B), and the melting temperaturedecreased from 47. 21 to 42. 35 Â°C with the increasing of the irradiation time. There appeared two Tm peaks, one due to the Tm of PEG segments, the other due to the Tm of 4sPCL segments. Figure 2. DSC curves of c-4sPCL(2K)â€“PEG-1:1 (A), c-4sPCL(2K)â€“PEG-2:1 (B), c-4sPCL(4K)â€“PEG-1:1and c-4sPCL(4K)â€“PEG-2:1under different irradiation times. For c-4sPCL(4k)â€“PEG (1:1), after 1 and 2 h irradiation, there appear two melting temperatures owning to 4sPCL and PEG segments, respectively (Figure 2C), while after 3 h irradiation, there is only one melting temperature, and a wider high elasticity transition region occurs than that of the species irradiated for 1 and 2 h. This result indicated that the network structure with higher degree of cross-linking could be obtained with the increase of the irradiation time. From Figure 2D, we can find that Tm and high elasticity regions have not obvious changes at various irradiation times, probably due to the fact that the movement of the macromolecule chains is restricted to some extent with the increase of the molecular weight of PCL segments, leading to the preferable photodipolymerization of PCLâ€“CA. Therefore, c-4sPCL(4K)â€“PEGunder 3 h irradiation possesses a high elasticity transition region as well as a broad melting transition region, which can meet the key requirements of temperature memory effect. Dynamic Mechanical AnalysisTo further evaluate the transition temperature of these resultant polymers, dynamic mechanical analysiswas employed. Figure 3 shows the DMA curves of c-4sPCLâ€“PEG with different ratios of 4sPCL and PEG upon 3 h irradiation. Observed from the curves of storage modulusand tan Î´ vs temperature, all species have a wide transition temperature region from 20 to 60 Â°C, and below room temperature the Eâ€² increases with the increasing of 4sPCL content and its molecular weight, owing to the crystallization of more 4sPCL segments and the higher molecular weight of 4sPCL. There is a decrease of more than 1 order of magnitude for the Eâ€² with the increasing of temperature, due to the melting transition of 4sPCL and PEG segments. The continuous increase in tan Î´ until Tm of PEG and PCL segments, where a sharp increase is observed, is due to the melting transition temperature of 4sPCL and PEG segment, and the decrease of tan Î´ from âˆ¼50 to 65 Â°C is due to the melting of the un-cross-linked molecular chains in the networks. Moreover, the SMPs with a higher storage modulus would possess a faster recovery ratio. Thus, the species of c-4sPCL(4K)â€“PEG (1:1)-3h could be selected as a temperature memory polymer since it possesses a wide transition temperature. Moreover, after 3 h of irradiation, it had the highest gel fraction than any other species. On the basis of these guidelines, it can be concluded that the polymer possess a good temperature memory property. Figure 3. DMA curves of c-4sPCLâ€“PEG with different compositions. The Temperature Memory Effect of c-4sPCL(4K)â€“PEG (1:1)-3hTo study the temperature memory effect, we chose the c-4sPCL (4K)-PEG sample with PCL/PEG weight ratio of 1:1 under 3 h irradiation (c-4sPCL(4K)â€“PEG(1:1)-3h), whose transition temperature can be tailored over a wide temperature range up to 45 Â°C. The investigation of TME took place at 37 and 45 Â°C, respectively, spanning a temperature range near the temperature for biomedical devices application. The stressâ€“strain-temperature curves are obtained from DMA testing. Parts A and B of Figure 4 show the quantitative demonstration of temperature memory properties with the deformation temperature set at 37 and 45 Â°C for two cycles, respectively. The results indicate that the material possesses a good shape fixity ratioand shape recovery ratioeither Td = 37 or 45 Â°C. The Rf and Rr were calculated using eqs 3 and 4, and the results were summarized in Table S4 in the Supporting Information. Both the Rf and Rr are beyond 80%, indicating an excellent temperature memory function. Figure 4. Shape fixity and shape recovery process at different deformation temperatures tested with DMA two times. Td = 37 Â°Cand 45 Â°C (B). DMA curves in Figure 5A show two curves of the recovery ratioagainst temperature (T), which possesses two Tds at 37 and 45 Â°C. The Rr values have pronounced differences with the increasing of temperature.

25278,25288,10,"2D-FTIR results verify the crystallization process of c-PCLâ€“PEG theoretically. Therefore, from the results of XRD and 2D-FTIR, we can find that in this system the temperature memory is actually able to remember various crystalline states at different temperatures, which is similar to the previous reports. On the basis of the above results, the schematic model of how the crystallizable chains of the star networks under different temperatures were used to influence the temperature memory effect was constructed (as shown in Scheme 2). In this polymer network, there are two kinds of crystalline segments, and at the high temperature of above 55 Â°C, all of the crystallization chain and amorphous chain show freedom of movement. With the decreasing of the temperature to the deformation temperature of 37 or 45 Â°C, there is partial crystallization, and there is a different DOC at different temperatures. Subsequently, with the decreasing of temperature to the low temperature of below 20 Â°C, the polymer possesses a good crystalline characterization. The tunable crystallite segment acts as the reversible phase, and the photo-cross-linked region acts as the fixed phase. Scheme 2. Schematic of the Variation of the Crystalline Unit in the Star Polymer Networks at Different Temperatures in the Process of Temperature MemoryTop of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferences4 ConclusionsIn summary, we have designed a new strategy for achieving highly responding temperature memory polymer networks through simple photo-cross-linking with cinnamon groups. In this system, the star polymer network was composed of a widely high elasticity transition region owing to the photo cross-linking and a partly overlap melting transition temperature due to the melting transition of PCL and PEG. The results of Rr and Vr against temperature indicated that the polymer possess a good temperature memory effect, and there is maximum recovery speed at the deformed temperature. The temperature memory of the star polymer networks is actually to remember various crystalline states at different temperatures.

26157,26162,5,"(Elsevier B. V. ) This paper discusses the gas permeation properties of poly(PEO)-based segmented block copolymers contg. monodisperse amide segments. These monodisperse segments give rise to a well phase-sepd. morphol. , comprising a continuous PEO phase with dispersed crystd. amide segments. The influence of the polyether phase compn. and of the temp. on the permeation properties of various gases (i. e. , CO2, N2, He, CH4, O2 and H2) as well as on the pure gas selectivities were studied in the temp. range of -5 Â°C to 75 Â°C. The CO2 permeability increased strongly with PEO concn. , and this effect could partly be explained by the dispersed hard segment concn. and partly by the changing chain flexibility. By decreasing the PEO melting temp. the low temp. permeabilities were improved. The gas transport values were dependant on both the dispersed hard segment concn. and the polyether segment length (length between crosslinks). The gas selectivities were dependant on the polyether segment length and thus the chain flexibility.

This work studies the transient rheol. responses of different entangled melts to startup deformation at unconventionally high rates, which can be accessed by working at sufficiently low temp. , e. g. , at and below 130 Â°C for polystyrene. When the rate is as high as the second crossover frequency Ï‰e obsd. from the small amplitude oscillatory sheardata for storage and loss modulus G' and G'', there is sizable viscous stress that dominates the initial mech. response. It is shown based on the various polymer melts including PS, PMMA, SBR, PC, and PS mixts. that this viscous component of the stress cannot be neglected when characterizing such fast deformation in either extension or shear. This sizable frictional addn. to the rubber elasticity component of the initial stress is founded to be preceded by solid-like deformation. The remarkable transient elasticity can be characterized by a modulus Ginterseg that grows well beyond the magnitude of the melt plateau modulus G0N as the temp. lowers toward the glass transition temp. Tg. In the case of PS, Ginterseg reaches a level of 300 MPa at 110 Â°C and reduces to 2. 0 MPa, i. e. , 10G0N, at 130 Â°C. The initial elasticity is short-lived because the melts quickly transition to a state of viscous flow at a strain of just a few percent. The magnitude of the viscous stress at the solid-to-liq. transition defines a yield stress. This yield stress is found to scale with the applied rate in a power law, agreeing with the dependence of G'' on frequency Ï‰ from the SAOS data. Moreover, the intersegmental effect, i. e. , the transient elasticity, is shown to also take place in unentangled and barely entangled PS melts as well as branched polyisoprene melts.",,ma5022083,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,,,,0,rheology of entangled polymers not far above glass transition temperature transient elasticity and intersegmental viscous stresssun hao liu gengxin ntetsikas konstantinos avgeropoulos apostolos wang shiqingmacromolecules2014 47 16 58395850 coden mamobx issn00249297 this work studies the transient rheol responses of different entangled melts to startup deformation at unconventionally high rates which can be accessed by working at sufficiently low temp  e g  at and below 130 c for polystyrene when the rate is as high as the second crossover frequency e obsd from the small amplitude oscillatory sheardata for storage and loss modulus g and g there is sizable viscous stress that dominates the initial mech response it is shown based on the various polymer melts including ps pmma sbr pc and ps mixts that this viscous component of the stress cannot be neglected when characterizing such fast deformation in either extension or shear this sizable frictional addn to the rubber elasticity component of the initial stress is founded to be preceded by solidlike deformation the remarkable transient elasticity can be characterized by a modulus ginterseg that grows well beyond the magnitude of the melt plateau modulus g0n as the temp lowers toward the glass transition temp tg in the case of ps ginterseg reaches a level of 300 mpa at 110 c and reduces to 2 0 mpa i e  10g0n at 130 c the initial elasticity is shortlived because the melts quickly transition to a state of viscous flow at a strain of just a few percent the magnitude of the viscous stress at the solidtoliq transition defines a yield stress this yield stress is found to scale with the applied rate in a power law agreeing with the dependence of g on frequency  from the saos data moreover the intersegmental effect i e  the transient elasticity is shown to also take place in unentangled and barely entangled ps melts as well as branched polyisoprene melts,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.94653213, 'word': 'polystyrene', 'start': 516, 'end': 527}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96065825, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 818, 'end': 820}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.94525033, 'word': 'pmma', 'start': 822, 'end': 826}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.893517, 'word': 'sbr', 'start': 828, 'end': 831}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.93172145, 'word': 'pc', 'start': 833, 'end': 835}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9569172, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 841, 'end': 843}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9622371, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 1347, 'end': 1349}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.75487614, 'word': '300 mpa', 'start': 1380, 'end': 1387}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.6915474, 'word': '2. 0 mpa', 'start': 1414, 'end': 1422}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.6424201, 'word': '10g0n', 'start': 1432, 'end': 1437}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.961798, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 1961, 'end': 1963}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER_FAMILY', 'score': 0.4188841, 'word': 'poly', 'start': 1990, 'end': 1994}]","300 mpa, 2. 0 mpa, 10g0n"

Both mid-IR and NIR bands of an LPEI aq. soln. above 64 Â°C exhibited a broader bandwidth than those at room temp. Judging from the change of the bandwidth, the LPEI chain in water was disordered by heating to take a random-coil form. In addn. , band locations of the CH stretching first-overtone vibration bands in a NIR spectrum of the soln. above 64 Â°C were higher than those of melted dry LPEI, which was reasonably understandable that the disordered LPEI chains in the aq. soln. were in a highly hydrated state.

Top of PageAbstractIntroductionExperimental SectionResults and DiscussionConclusionsReferencesResults and Discussion According to the data listed in Table 1, the actual composition x of the PPCâˆ’OA-x complexes is always lower than the expected value xcal (Table 1). This is due to the fact that only partial OA were bound to PPC molecules, and the unbound OA molecules were removed from the precomplexes in the purification process. The thermal properties of the complexes were characterized using TG and DSC methods. TG thermogramsindicate that the PPCâˆ’OA-x complexes are more thermally stable compared with pure OA and PPC. As shown in Table 2, the 5% weight-loss temperatureof PPC and OA are 179 and 198 Â°C, respectively. However, all the complexes exhibit a much higher T5% in the range of 217âˆ’264 Â°C, which means that the thermal stability of PPC has been improved greatly and this copolymer may have enhanced thermoplastic processability.

DSC tracesshow that OA give only one sharp melting peak at 69. 1 Â°C (Î”Hm = 215. 11 J/g) during the heating process, while the PPCâˆ’OA-x complexes (except x = 0. 0028) exhibit only one endothermic peak within a temperature range far beyond melting temperatureof pristine OA. In addition, the glass transition temperatureof PPC increased from 30. 4 Â°C to ca. 38 Â°C when it was bound by OA. As it has been reported previously that there is a thermotropic liquid crystalline state existing above Tm of OA in the PEIâˆ’OA complexes,we temporarily attribute the endothermic peak for PPCâˆ’OA complexes at ca. 126âˆ’128 Â°C to the isotropic temperature (Ti), corresponding to a transition from a liquid crystalline phase to an isotropic phase. In order to further elucidate the DSC results, WAXD, SAXS, TEM, and POM measurements were combined to verify the existence of the mesomorphous state in the PPCâˆ’OA complexes. Figure 2.

D. ; Ge, Qing; Quirk, Roderic P. ; Thomas, Edwin L. ; Lotz, Bernard; Hsiao, Benjamin S. ; Liu, Lizhi; Yeh, FengjiMacromolecules (2001), 34 (19), 6649-6657 CODEN: MAMOBX; ISSN:0024-9297. A lamella-forming poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrenediblock copolymer has been blended with a low mol. wt. polystyrenehomopolymer to form a miscible polymer blend. The PEO vol. fraction is 0. 32, and the order-disorder transition temp. of this blend is 175 Â°C. Therefore, the PEO blocks form nanocylinders surrounded by a PS matrix below the TODT. Since the glass transition temp. of the PS is 64 Â°C and the PEO crystal melting occurs at âˆ¼50 Â°C, the PEO-block crystn. takes place in a two-dimensionally confined glassy environment. The cylinder diam. is detd. to be 13. 7 nm, based on small-angle X-ray scatteringand transmission electron microscopy results. Using simultaneous two-dimensional SAXS and wide-angle X-ray scattering techniques, the crystal orientationwithin the nanocylinders is found to change simply depending upon the crystn. temp. (Tc). At very low Tc (<-30 Â°C), PEO crystals are randomly oriented within the confined cylinders. Starting at Tc = -30 Â°C, the crystal orientation changes to be inclined with respect to the cylinder axis, Ì‚a. The tilt angle from Ì‚a continuously increases with increasing Tc, and finally it becomes 90Â° when Tc â‰¥ 2 Â°C.",,ma7021925,1,1,1,1,1,1.0,these two (following) good examples for ELSIE,,,1,acs full text  cascrystal orientation changes in twodimensionally confined nanocylinders in a polyethylene oxidebpolystyrenepolystyrene blendhuang ping zhu lei cheng stephen z d  ge qing quirk roderic p  thomas edwin l  lotz bernard hsiao benjamin s  liu lizhi yeh fengjimacromolecules 2001 34 19 66496657 coden mamobx issn00249297 a lamellaforming polyethylene oxidebpolystyrenediblock copolymer has been blended with a low mol wt polystyrenehomopolymer to form a miscible polymer blend the peo vol fraction is 0 32 and the orderdisorder transition temp of this blend is 175 c therefore the peo blocks form nanocylinders surrounded by a ps matrix below the todt since the glass transition temp of the ps is 64 c and the peo crystal melting occurs at 50 c the peoblock crystn takes place in a twodimensionally confined glassy environment the cylinder diam is detd to be 13 7 nm based on smallangle xray scatteringand transmission electron microscopy results using simultaneous twodimensional saxs and wideangle xray scattering techniques the crystal orientationwithin the nanocylinders is found to change simply depending upon the crystn temp tc at very low tc 30 c peo crystals are randomly oriented within the confined cylinders starting at tc  30 c the crystal orientation changes to be inclined with respect to the cylinder axis a the tilt angle from a continuously increases with increasing tc and finally it becomes 90 when tc  2 c,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9685104, 'word': 'poly ( ethylene oxide ) - b - polystyrene', 'start': 100, 'end': 134}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9709429, 'word': 'polystyrene', 'start': 135, 'end': 146}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9667636, 'word': 'poly ( ethylene oxide ) - b - polystyrene', 'start': 397, 'end': 431}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.94910085, 'word': 'polystyrene', 'start': 486, 'end': 497}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9554266, 'word': 'peo', 'start': 547, 'end': 550}, {'entity_group': 'MATERIAL_AMOUNT', 'score': 0.8172872, 'word': '0. 32', 'start': 568, 'end': 573}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.79163635, 'word': 'order - disorder transition temp.', 'start': 583, 'end': 614}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.92660886, 'word': '175 a°c', 'start': 632, 'end': 639}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.96293586, 'word': 'peo', 'start': 656, 'end': 659}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9584377, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 702, 'end': 704}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_NAME', 'score': 0.7467699, 'word': 'glass transition temp.', 'start': 738, 'end': 760}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9584895, 'word': 'ps', 'start': 768, 'end': 770}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.92975855, 'word': '64 a°c', 'start': 774, 'end': 780}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.95637554, 'word': 'peo', 'start': 789, 'end': 792}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.6982033, 'word': '##50 a°c', 'start': 822, 'end': 828}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.95266414, 'word': 'peo', 'start': 834, 'end': 837}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.9607863, 'word': 'peo', 'start': 1267, 'end': 1270}]","175 a°c, 64 a°c, ##50 a°c"

The crystn. and melting behavior of poly(P3BT), poly(P3OT), and polywere studied. The equil. melting temps. of these polymers were measured and resulted equal to 321, 230, and 175 Â°C for P3BT, P3OT, and P3DDT, resp. The crystn. kinetics was evaluated by the Avrami equation: it proceeds by heterogeneous nucleation with one-dimensional linear growth (n = 1. 1-1. 8). The effects of the length of the alkyl side chain and of the undercooling were investigated. Phase I, Phase II, and a nematic mesophase were detected in P3BT and P3DDT. In P3BT, Phase I was differentiable from the mesophase on the basis of wide-angle X-ray scatteringpatterns. This study gives insight, in particular, on the crystn. and melting behavior of P3BT, a polymer not yet well studied. WAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and differential scanning calorimetrywere employed as exptl. techniques.

Complete deacetalization of the ketone acetal group of polyyields a poly (Î³-ketone-Îµ-caprolactone), poly(KCL), of a much higher melting temp. than that of unmodified PCL. The UV absorption spectrum of polydisplays a broad absorption band with a max. at 270 nm and an absorption tail extending beyond 300 nm, which is the signature of the ketone groups. This novel aliph. polyester does not greatly resemble PCL, but has a much higher melting temp. and the potential of being photodegradable.

31492,31499,7,"1 System Equilibration In Figure 2a, MD results are shown concerning equilibration of the C80 PIB system at three different temperatures, namely 350, 450, and 550 K, in terms of the decay of the time autocorrelation function âŸ¨u(t)Â·u(0)âŸ© for the unit vector u directed along the chain end-to-end vector. Figure 2b refers to the evolution of the mean square chain end-to-end distance, âŸ¨R2âŸ©, in two of the simulated systemswith time t. In all cases, the function âŸ¨u(t)Â·u(0)âŸ© is seen to decay to zero after a certain time, which depends strongly on T. This is true even for the lower temperature of 350 K where the âŸ¨u(t)Â·u(0)âŸ© function is seen to drop to zero rather slowly corresponding to a relaxation time of about 100 ns (as compared to about 5 ns for the same system at 450 K). This fast rise of the relaxation time with decreasing temperature is indicative of the difficulties faced by brute-force MD simulations in sampling the terminal relaxation properties of polymers in their submelt regime. âŸ¨R2âŸ© is also seen to relax to well-defined values, characteristic of a fully equilibrated system, for all temperatures examined. Similar behavior was obtained for the rest of the PIB systems simulated here whose relaxation is faster or slower compared to C80 at the same temperature, in accordance with the predictions of well-established theories, such as the Rouse, the modified Rouse, and the reptation, for the chain length dependence of terminal relaxation.

Evolution of the instantaneous value of the average chain end-to-end distance, âŸ¨R2âŸ©, with time t as obtained from the present MD simulations with the C80 and C120 systems at 450 K. 3. 2 Conformational Properties A critical test for the new UA force field introduced in this work concerns its accuracy in reproducing the conformational properties of PIB melt as quantified by the distributions of bond lengths, bending angles, dihedral angles and chain dimension parameters such as the average chain end-to-end distance, the radius of gyration, and the characteristic ratio. In Figure 3, the probability distribution of the population in the two bending angles along the backbone of a PIB chain (i. e. , at the CH2 atoms marked as Î¸1, and at the disubstituted C atoms marked as Î¸2 in Figure 1) at two different temperatures is shown.",,ma8007652,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,,,,0,1 system equilibration in figure 2a md results are shown concerning equilibration of the c80 pib system at three different temperatures namely 350 450 and 550 k in terms of the decay of the time autocorrelation function utu0 for the unit vector u directed along the chain endtoend vector figure 2b refers to the evolution of the mean square chain endtoend distance r2 in two of the simulated systemswith time t in all cases the function utu0 is seen to decay to zero after a certain time which depends strongly on t this is true even for the lower temperature of 350 k where the utu0 function is seen to drop to zero rather slowly corresponding to a relaxation time of about 100 ns as compared to about 5 ns for the same system at 450 k this fast rise of the relaxation time with decreasing temperature is indicative of the difficulties faced by bruteforce md simulations in sampling the terminal relaxation properties of polymers in their submelt regime r2 is also seen to relax to welldefined values characteristic of a fully equilibrated system for all temperatures examined similar behavior was obtained for the rest of the pib systems simulated here whose relaxation is faster or slower compared to c80 at the same temperature in accordance with the predictions of wellestablished theories such as the rouse the modified rouse and the reptation for the chain length dependence of terminal relaxation figure 2 time decay of the autocorrelation function of the chain endtoend unit vector utu0 corresponding to the c80 system at 350 450 and 550 k evolution of the instantaneous value of the average chain endtoend distance r2 with time t as obtained from the present md simulations with the c80 and c120 systems at 450 k 3 2 conformational properties a critical test for the new ua force field introduced in this work concerns its accuracy in reproducing the conformational properties of pib melt as quantified by the distributions of bond lengths bending angles dihedral angles and chain dimension parameters such as the average chain endtoend distance the radius of gyration and the characteristic ratio in figure 3 the probability distribution of the population in the two bending angles along the backbone of a pib chain i e  at the ch2 atoms marked as 1 and at the disubstituted c atoms marked as 2 in figure 1 at two different temperatures is shown,"[{'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.72060484, 'word': 'c80 pib', 'start': 90, 'end': 97}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.72315943, 'word': 'pib', 'start': 1201, 'end': 1204}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.5713779, 'word': 'c80', 'start': 1277, 'end': 1280}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.6511657, 'word': 'c80', 'start': 1614, 'end': 1617}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.50312257, 'word': 'c80', 'start': 1803, 'end': 1806}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.48635972, 'word': 'c120', 'start': 1811, 'end': 1815}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.75368184, 'word': 'pib', 'start': 2002, 'end': 2005}]",

The observed low conversionscould be connected with some loss of single addition productafter solvent evaporation,whereas the low conversion in run 1 arose from a slow polymerization rate (high [HFPO]0/[CsF]0 molar ratio). One important conclusion from these preliminary batch experiments is the possibility of using a â€œsaferâ€ solvent, 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane (C4F5H5), in place of the expensive, toxic, and banned R-113without any deleterious effect on reaction (compare runs 4 and 5 in Table 1).

Effect of Temperature and Catalyst Content Table 3 reports a summary of different experimental results where the influence of the polymerization temperature and [HFPO]0/[KF]0 ratio on the monomer conversion and average DPnof the obtained poly(hexafluoropropylene oxide)s were studied. An increase in the polymerization temperature from âˆ’35 to âˆ’15 Â°C led to a significant enhancement in the monomer conversionas well as an increase in the number-average degree of polymerization from 8to 10(see runs 10 and 11 in Table 3). Still, the amount of low molar mass byproduct in both experiments remained high (15âˆ’20%). It should be noted that, for oligo(hexafluoropropylene oxide)s of molar masses larger than 1500 g molâˆ’1, DPn values calculated using GC data were systematically underestimated compared to those determined by NMR spectroscopy (see also Figure S2). Such a result arises from the limit of our GC technique; i. e. , higher molar mass fractions do not appear in GC chromatograms. These discrepancies have not been found detrimental for concluding on this mainly qualitative mechanistic study (see Discussion part). Table 3.

A further increase of the polymerization temperature up to 0 Â°C did not significantly affect the monomer conversion or the average DPn but led to a decrease of low molar mass oligomers content (down to 10%, run 12, Table 3). This content was even further decreased by raising the [HFPO]0/[KF]0 ratio from 15 to 40 or 60, for which the number-average degree of polymerization reached 12âˆ’13and oligomeric byproduct settled down to ca. âˆ¼ 4âˆ’7% (runs 13 and 14 in Table 3). An additional increase in the [HFPO]0/[KF]0 ratio almost did not influence either the DPn or the content of low molar mass oligomers (runs 14 and 15, Table 3). Indeed, a comparison of GC chromatograms of polymers obtained at âˆ’35 Â°Cand 0 Â°Creveals a large shift of the oligomer distribution toward the high molar mass region, where peaks are no more resolved (Figure 3). Importantly, only low quantities of low molar mass oligomers are present in the crude polymer. Finally, raising the polymerization temperature to 20 Â°C generated back low molar mass polymer (runs 16 and 17, Table 3), in which average DPn and distribution profile are similar to the ones obtained at âˆ’35 Â°C (see GC chromatogram of oligoHFPO obtained at 20 Â°C in Figure S3).",,ma8012338,1,1,1,1,1,0.0,,,,0,interestingly only a very low amount of products with dpn ranging between 2 and 4was detected by gc table 2 anionic polymerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide with different alkali metal fluorides mfa runcatalystmf content mmollattice energykcal mol1hfpo0catalyst0conv dpngcdpnbnmr7csf9 017620561 91 78kf19 519215536 97 79naf24 021515121 0 a reaction conditions c4f5h5 10 ml mf0tetraglyme0 ca 11 8 m  cs k na temperature 35 c polymerization time 2 h b dpnwas calculated according to figure 4 figure 2 gas chromatogram of fcfcf3cf2oxcfcf3cooch3 obtained in run 8 in table 2 effect of temperature and catalyst content table 3 reports a summary of different experimental results where the influence of the polymerization temperature and hfpo0kf0 ratio on the monomer conversion and average dpnof the obtained polyhexafluoropropylene oxides were studied an increase in the polymerization temperature from 35 to 15 c led to a significant enhancement in the monomer conversionas well as an increase in the numberaverage degree of polymerization from 8to 10see runs 10 and 11 in table 3 still the amount of low molar mass byproduct in both experiments remained high 1520 it should be noted that for oligohexafluoropropylene oxides of molar masses larger than 1500 g mol1 dpn values calculated using gc data were systematically underestimated compared to those determined by nmr spectroscopy see also figure s2 such a result arises from the limit of our gc technique i e  higher molar mass fractions do not appear in gc chromatograms these discrepancies have not been found detrimental for concluding on this mainly qualitative mechanistic study see discussion part table 3 polymerization of hexafluoropropylene oxide with kftetraglyme system at different temperatures and different hfpo0kf0 ratiosa runtemp chfpo0kf0conv dpngcdpncnmrmndg mol1mwmnecontent of dpn  5103515536 97 716201 0720 5111515889 110 120201 1014 312015898 910 320501 0810 513b040899 513 125001 106 914b060929 912 023301 084 015b0120908 410 120201 097 516b1040908 89 318901 064 317b2040915 46 313901 1137 3 a reaction conditions c4f5h5 10 ml kf0tetraglyme0 ca 11 8 polymerization time 2 h b polymerization time 3 h c dpnwas calculated according to figure 4 d mn dpn 166  185 159 tail group e calculated based on gc data see experimental part for details a further increase of the polymerization temperature up to 0 c did not significantly affect the monomer conversion or the average dpn but led to a decrease of low molar mass oligomers content down to 10 run 12 table 3 this content was even further decreased by raising the hfpo0kf0 ratio from 15 to 40 or 60 for which the numberaverage degree of polymerization reached 1213and oligomeric byproduct settled down to ca  47 runs 13 and 14 in table 3 an additional increase in the hfpo0kf0 ratio almost did not influence either the dpn or the content of low molar mass oligomers runs 14 and 15 table 3 indeed a comparison of gc chromatograms of polymers obtained at 35 cand 0 creveals a large shift of the oligomer distribution toward the high molar mass region where peaks are no more resolved figure 3 importantly only low quantities of low molar mass oligomers are present in the crude polymer finally raising the polymerization temperature to 20 c generated back low molar mass polymer runs 16 and 17 table 3 in which average dpn and distribution profile are similar to the ones obtained at 35 c see gc chromatogram of oligohfpo obtained at 20 c in figure s3,"[{'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.7242202, 'word': 'hexafluoropropylene oxide', 'start': 137, 'end': 162}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.68828493, 'word': '##9. 017620561. 91. 78kf19. 519215536. 97. 79naf24. 021515121.', 'start': 310, 'end': 370}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.34488755, 'word': 'hfp', 'start': 800, 'end': 803}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7989621, 'word': 'poly ( hexafluoropropylene oxide )', 'start': 876, 'end': 907}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.7462493, 'word': 'oligo ( hexafluoropropylene oxide )', 'start': 1286, 'end': 1318}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.6211907, 'word': '1500 g mola', 'start': 1348, 'end': 1359}, {'entity_group': 'PROP_VALUE', 'score': 0.566178, 'word': '1', 'start': 1361, 'end': 1362}, {'entity_group': 'MONOMER', 'score': 0.71600926, 'word': 'hexafluoropropylene oxide', 'start': 1796, 'end': 1821}, {'entity_group': 'POLYMER', 'score': 0.34594858, 'word': 'hfp', 'start': 1889, 'end': 1892}]","##9. 017620561. 91. 78kf19. 519215536. 97. 79naf24. 021515121., 1500 g mola, 1"
